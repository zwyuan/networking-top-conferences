<span id="toHide2" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In November 2008, the FCC ruled that the digital TV whitespaces be used for unlicensed access. This is an exciting development because DTV whitespaces are in the low frequency range (50-698 MHz) compared to typical cellular and ISM bands, thus resulting in much better propagation characteristics and much higher spectral efficiencies. The FCC has also mandated certain guidelines for short range unlicensed access, so as to avoid any interference to DTV receivers. We consider the problem of WiFi like access (popularly referred to as WiFi 2.0) for enterprizes. We assume that the access points and client devices are equipped with cognitive radios, i.e., they can adaptively choose the center frequency, bandwidth and ower of operation. The access points can be equipped with one or more radios. Our goal is to design a complete system, which <i>(i)</i> does not violate the FCC mandate, <i>(ii)</i> dynamically assigns center frequency and bandwidth to each access point based on their demands and <i>(iii)</i> squeezes the maximum efficiency from the available spectrum. This problem is far more general than prior work that investigated dynamic spectrum allocation in cellular and ISM bands, due to the non-homogenous nature of the whitespaces, i.e., different whitespace widths in different parts of the spectrum and the large range of frequency bands with different propagation characteristics. This calls for a more holistic approach to system design that also accounts for frequency dependent propagation characteristics and radio frontend characteristics. In this paper, we first propose design rules for holistic system design. We then describe an architecture derived from our design rules. Finally we propose demand based dynamic spectrum allocation algorithms with provable worst case guarantees. We provide extensive simulation results showing that <i>(i)</i> the performance of our algorithm is within 94% of the optimal in typical settings and <i>(ii)</i> and the DTV whitespaces can provide significantly higher data rates compared to the 2.4GHz ISM band. Our approach is general enough for designing any system with access to a wide range of spectrum.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll2" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll2',2)">expand</a>

The increasing volume of literature calls for a deeper understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum utilization. In this paper we present a detailed spectrum measurement study, with data collected in the 20MHz to 3GHz spectrum band and at four locations concurrently in South China. We examine the first and second order statistics of the collected data, including channel occupancy/vacancy statistics, channel utilization within each individual wireless service, and the temporal, spectral, and spatial correlation of these measures. Main findings include that the channel vacancy durations follow an exponential-like distribution, but are not independently distributed over time, and that significant spectral and spatial correlations are found between channels of the same service. We then exploit such spectrum correlation to develop a 2-dimensional frequent pattern mining algorithm that can accurately predict channel availability based on past observations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Establishing a control channel for medium access control is a challenging problem in multi-channel and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) networks. In the design of multi-channel MAC protocols, the use of channel (or frequency) hopping techniques (a.k.a. parallel rendezvous) have been proposed to avoid the bottleneck of a single control channel. In DSA networks, the dynamic and opportunistic use of the available spectrum requires that the radios are able to "rendezvous" -- i.e., find each other to establish a link. The use of a dedicated global control channel simplifies the rendezvous process but may not be feasible in many opportunistic spectrum sharing scenarios due to the dynamically changing availability of all the channels, including the control channel. To address this problem, researchers have proposed the use of channel hopping protocols for enabling rendezvous in DSA networks.</p> <p>This paper presents a systematic approach, based on quorum systems, for designing and analyzing channel hopping protocols for the purpose of control channel establishment. The proposed approach, called Quorum-based Channel Hopping (QCH) system, can be used for implementing rendezvous protocols in DSA networks that are robust against link breakage caused by the appearance of incumbent user signals. We describe two optimal QCH systems under the assumption of global clock synchronization: the first system is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the time-to-rendezvous between any two channel hopping sequences; the second system is optimal in the sense that it guarantees the even distribution of the rendezvous points in terms of both time and channel, thus solving the \emph{rendezvous convergence} problem. We also propose an asynchronous QCH system that does not require global clock synchronization. Our analytical and simulation results show that the channel hopping schemes designed using our framework outperform existing schemes under various network conditions.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we exploit channel diversity for opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). Our approach uses channel quality as a second criterion (along with the idle/busy status of the channel) in selecting channels to use for opportunistic transmission. The difficulty of the problem comes from the fact that it is practically infeasible for a CR to first scan all channels and then pick the best among them, due to the potentially large number of channels open to OSA and the limited power/hardware capability of a CR. As a result, the CR can only sense and probe channels sequentially. To avoid collisions with other CRs, after sensing and probing a channel, the CR needs to make a decision on whether to terminate the scan and use the underlying channel or to skip it and scan the next one. The optimal use-or-skip decision strategy that maximizes the CR's average throughput is one of our primary concerns in this study. This problem is further complicated by practical considerations, such as sensing/probing overhead and sensing errors. An optimal decision strategy that addresses all the above considerations is derived by formulating the sequential sensing/probing process as a rate-of-return problem, which we solve using optimal stopping theory. We further explore the special structure of this strategy to conduct a "second-round" optimization over the operational parameters, such as the sensing and probing times. We show through simulations that significant throughput gains (e.g., about 100%) are achieved using our joint sensing/probing scheme over the conventional one that uses sensing alone.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

Due to the asynchronous and uncontrolled nature of wireless LANs, conventional MIMO technology does not work efficiently when concurrent transmissions from multiple stations are uncoordinated. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a crosslayer system, called SAM, that addresses the challenges of enabling spatial multiple access for multiple devices in a random access network like WLAN. SAM uses a <i>chain-decoding</i> technique to reliably recover the channel parameters for each device, and iteratively decode concurrent frames with misaligned symbol timings and frequency offsets. We propose a new MAC protocol, called CCMA, to enable concurrent transmissions by different mobile stations while remaining backward compatible with 802.11. Finally, we implement the PHY and MAC layer of SAM using the Sora high-performance software radio platform. Our evaluation results under real wireless conditions show that SAM can improve network uplink throughput by 70% with two antennas over 802.11.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll7" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll7',7)">expand</a>

Briefly, MIM allows a receiver to disengage from an ongoing reception, and engage onto a stronger incoming signal. Links that otherwise conflict with each other, can be made concurrent with MIM. However, the concurrency is not immediate, and can be achieved only if conflicting links begin transmission in a specific order. The importance of link order is new in wireless research, motivating MIM-aware revisions to link scheduling protocols. This paper identifies the opportunity in MIM-aware reordering, characterizes the optimal improvement in throughput, and designs a link layer protocol to achieve it.

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents an efficient opportunistic retransmission protocol (PRO, Protocol for Retransmitting Opportunistically) to improve the performance of IEEE 802.11 WLANs. PRO is a link-layer protocol that allows overhearing nodes to function as relays that retransmit on behalf of the source after they learn about a failed transmission. Relays with stronger connectivity to the destination have a higher chance of delivering the packet than the source does, thereby resulting in a more efficient use of the channel. PRO has four main features. First, channel reciprocity coupled with a run-time calibration process is used to estimate the instantaneous link quality to the destination. Second, a local qualification process filters out poor relays early. Third, a distributed relay selection algorithm chooses the best set of eligible relays among all qualified relays and prioritizes them. Finally, 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) is leveraged to make sure high priority relays transmit with high probability. PRO is designed to coexist with legacy 802.11 stations. We have implemented PRO in the driver of a commodity wireless card. Our extensive evaluation on both a controlled testbed and in the real world shows that PRO boosts throughput in diverse wireless environments, and especially in when there is significant contention for the channels, under fading, and with user mobility.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we present Esense: a new paradigm of communication between devices that have fundamentally different physical layers. The same communication framework also works between devices that have the same physical layer, which are out of communication range but within carrier-sense range. Esense is based on sensing and interpreting energy profiles. While our ideas are generic enough to be applicable in a variety of contexts, we illustrate the usefulness of our ideas by presenting novel solutions to existing problems in three distinct research domains. As part of these solutions, we demonstrate the ability to communicate between devices that follow two different standards: IEEE 802.11 and 802.15.4. We build an ``alphabet set'': a set of signature packet sizes which can be used for Esense. For this, we take a measurement based approach by considering WiFi traces from actual deployments. We then analyze the channel activity resulting from these traces and build an appropriate alphabet set for Esense communication. Our results show that we could potentially construct an alphabet of size as high as 100; such a large alphabet size promises efficient Esense communication. We also validate this alphabet set via a prototype implementation, and show that effective communication is indeed feasible even when both sides use different physical layers.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In the literature, asymptotic studies of multi-hop wireless network capacity often consider only centralized and deterministic TDMA (time-division multi-access) coordination schemes. There have been fewer studies of the asymptotic capacity of large-scale wireless networks based on CSMA (carrier-sensing multi-access), which schedules transmissions in a distributed and random manner. With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a critical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA networks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we first formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique CSMA characteristics, not captured by existing interference models in the literature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently the capacity of CSMA networks. %and are functions of various CSMA parameters. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA scheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to maximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA can achieve throughput as Ω(1/√<i>n</i>), the same order as optimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks. Our CSMA scheme makes use of an efficient backbone-peripheral routing scheme and a careful design of dual carrier-sensing and dual channel scheme. We also address practical implementation issues of our capacity-optimal CSMA scheme.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll12" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll12',12)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The capacity scaling property specifies the changes in network throughput when network size increases and serves as an essential performance evaluation metric for large-scale wireless networks. Existing results have been obtained based on the implicit assumption of negligible overhead in acquiring the network topology and synchronizing the link transmissions. In large networks, however, global topology collection and global link synchronization are infeasible with both the centralized and the distributed link scheduling schemes. This gap between the well-known capacity results and the impractical assumption on link scheduling potentially undermines our understanding of the <i>achievable</i> network capacity. Therefore, the following question remains open: can <i>localized</i> scheduling algorithms achieve the same order of capacity as their global counterpart? In this paper, we propose the <i>scheduling partition</i> methodology by decomposing a large network into many small autonomous scheduling zones, in which localized scheduling algorithms are implemented independently from one another. We prove that any localized scheduling algorithm that satisfies a set of sufficient and necessary conditions can yield the same order of capacity as the widely assumed global scheduling strategy. In comparison to the network dimension √<i>n</i>, scheduling partition sizes Θ(√log <i>n</i>) and Θ(1) are sufficient for optimal capacity scaling in the random and the arbitrary node placement models respectively. We finally propose an example localized link scheduling algorithm to verify the capacity achieved by scheduling partition. Our results thus provide guidelines on the scheduling algorithm design toward maximum capacity scaling in large-scale wireless networks.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper we investigate the connectivity for large-scale clustered wireless sensor and ad hoc networks. We study the effect of mobility on the critical transmission range for asymptotic connectivity in <i>k</i>-hop clustered networks, and compare to existing results on non-clustered stationary networks. By introducing <i>k</i>-hop clustering, any packet from a cluster member can reach a cluster head within <i>k</i> hops, and thus the transmission delay is bounded as Θ(1) for any finite <i>k</i>. We first characterize the critical transmission range for connectivity in mobile <i>k</i>-hop clustered networks where all nodes move under either the random walk mobility model with non-trivial velocity or the i.i.d. mobility model. By the term <i>non-trivial velocity</i>, we mean that the velocity of nodes <i>v</i> is Θ(1). We then compare with the critical transmission range for stationary <i>k</i>-hop clustered networks. We also study the transmission power versus delay trade-off and the average energy consumption per flow among different types of networks. We show that random walk mobility with non-trivial velocity increases connectivity in <i>k</i>-hop clustered networks, and thus significantly decreases the energy consumption and improves the power-delay trade-off. The decrease of energy consumption per flow is shown to be Θ(log<i>n</i>/<i>n<sup>d</sup></i>}) in clustered networks. These results provide insights on network design and fundamental guidelines on building a large-scale wireless network.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Intended for network-wide dissemination of commands, configurations and code binaries, flooding has been investigated extensively in wireless networks. However, little work has yet been done on low-duty-cycle wireless sensor networks in which nodes stay asleep most of time and wake up asynchronously. In this type of network, a broadcasting packet is rarely received by multiple nodes simultaneously, a unique constraining feature that makes existing solutions unsuitable. Combined with unreliable links, flooding in low-duty-cycle networks is a new challenging issue.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce Opportunistic Flooding, a novel design tailored for low-duty-cycle networks with unreliable wireless links and predetermined working schedules. The key idea is to make probabilistic forwarding decisions at a sender based on the delay distribution of next-hop nodes. Only <i>opportunistically early</i> packets are forwarded using links outside the energy optimal tree to reduce the flooding delay and redundancy in transmission. To improve performance further, we propose a forwarder selection method to alleviate the hidden terminal problem and a link-quality-based backoff method to resolve simultaneous forwarding operations. We evaluate Opportunistic Flooding with extensive simulation and a test-bed implementation consisting of 30 MicaZ nodes. Evaluation shows our design is close to the optimal performance achievable by oracle flooding designs. Compared with improved traditional flooding, our design achieves significantly shorter flooding delay while consuming only 20% ~ 60% of the transmission energy in various low-duty-cycle network settings.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

The successful scheme developed in this research is expected to offer fresh frame of mind for research in both compressive sampling applications and large-scale wireless sensor networks. We consider the scenario in which a large number of sensor nodes are densely deployed and sensor readings are spatially correlated. The proposed compressive data gathering is able to reduce global scale communication cost without introducing intensive computation or complicated transmission control. The load balancing characteristic is capable of extending the lifetime of the entire sensor network as well as individual sensors. Furthermore, the proposed scheme can cope with abnormal sensor readings gracefully. We also carry out the analysis of the network capacity of the proposed compressive data gathering and validate the analysis through ns-2 simulations. More importantly, this novel compressive data gathering has been tested on real sensor data and the results show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed scheme.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll17" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll17',17)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been increasingly available for critical applications such as security surveillance and environmental monitoring. An important performance measure of such applications is sensing coverage that characterizes how well a sensing field is monitored by a network. Although advanced collaborative signal processing algorithms have been adopted by many existing WSNs, most previous analytical studies on sensing coverage are conducted based on overly simplistic sensing models (e.g., the disc model) that do not capture the stochastic nature of sensing. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap by exploring the fundamental limits of coverage based on stochastic data fusion models that fuse noisy measurements of multiple sensors. We derive the scaling laws between coverage, network density, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We show that data fusion can significantly improve sensing coverage by exploiting the collaboration among sensors. In particular, for signal path loss exponent of k (typically between 2.0 and 5.0), rho_f=O(rho_d^(1-1/k)), where rho_f and rho_d are the densities of uniformly deployed sensors that achieve full coverage under the fusion and disc models, respectively. Our results help understand the limitations of the previous analytical results based on the disc model and provide key insights into the design of WSNs that adopt data fusion algorithms. Our analyses are verified through extensive simulations based on both synthetic data sets and data traces collected in a real deployment for vehicle detection.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless Sensor Networks are emerging as a key sensing technology, with diverse military and civilian applications. In these networks, a large number of sensors perform distributed sensing of a target field. Each sensor is a small battery-operated device that can sense events of interest in its sensing range and can communicate with neighboring sensors. A sensor cover is a subset of the set of all sensors such that every point in the target field is in the interior of the sensing ranges of at least $k$ different sensors in the subset, where k is a given positive integer. The lifetime of the network is the time from the point the network starts operation until the set of all sensors with non-zero remaining energy does not constitute a sensor cover. An important goal in sensor networks is to design a schedule, that is, a sequence of sensor covers to activate in every time slot, so as to maximize the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we design a polynomial-time, distributed algorithm for maximizing the lifetime of the network and prove that its lifetime is at most a factor O(log n * log nB) lower than the maximum possible lifetime, where n is the number of sensors and B is an upper bound on the initial energy of each sensor. Our algorithm does not require knowledge of the locations of nodes or directional information, which is difficult to obtain in sensor networks. Each sensor only needs to know the distances between adjacent nodes in its transmission range and their sensing radii. In every slot, the algorithm first assigns a weight to each node that is exponential in the fraction of its initial energy that has been used up so far. Then, in a distributed manner, it finds a O(log n) approximate minimum weight sensor cover which it activates in the slot. Our simulations reveal that our algorithm substantially outperforms several existing lifetime maximization algorithms.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Neighbor discovery is one of the first steps in the initialization of a wireless ad hoc network. In this paper, we design and analyze practical algorithms for neighbor discovery in wireless networks. We first consider an ALOHA-like neighbor discovery algorithm in a synchronous system, proposed in an earlier work. When nodes do not have a collision detection mechanism, we show that this algorithm reduces to the classical {\em Coupon Collector's Problem}. Consequently, we show that each node discovers all its $n$ neighbors in an expected time equal to $ne (\ln n + c)$, for some constant $c$. When nodes have a collision detection mechanism, we propose an algorithm based on receiver status feedback which yields a $\ln n$ improvement over the ALOHA-like algorithm. Our algorithms do not require nodes to have any estimate of the number of neighbors. In particular, we show that not knowing $n$ results in no more than a factor of two slowdown in the algorithm performance. In the absence of node synchronization, we develop asynchronous neighbor discovery algorithms that are only a factor of two slower than their synchronous counterparts. We show that our algorithms can achieve neighbor discovery despite allowing nodes to begin execution at different time instants. Furthermore, our algorithms allow each node to detect when to terminate the neighbor discovery phase.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide22" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>There has been burgeoning interest in wireless technologies that can use wider frequency spectrum. Technology advances, such as 802.11n and ultra-wideband (UWB), are pushing toward wider frequency bands. The analog-to-digital TV transition has made 100-250 MHz of digital whitespace bandwidth available for unlicensed access. Also, recent work on WiFi networks has advocated discarding the notion of channelization and allowing all nodes to access the wide 802.11 spectrum in order to improve load balancing. This shift towards wider bands presents an opportunity to exploit frequency diversity. Specifically, frequencies that are far from each other in the spectrum have significantly different SNRs, and good frequencies differ across sender-receiver pairs.</p> <p>This paper presents FARA, a combined frequency-aware rate adaptation and MAC protocol. FARA makes three departures from conventional wireless network design: First, it presents a scheme to robustly compute per-frequency SNRs using normal data transmissions. Second, instead of using one bit rate per link, it enables a sender to adapt the bitrate independently across frequencies based on these per-frequency SNRs. Third, in contrast to traditional frequency-oblivious MAC protocols, it introduces a MAC protocol that allocates to a sender-receiver pair the frequencies that work best for that pair. We have implemented FARA in FPGA on a wideband 802.11-compatible radio platform. Our experiments reveal that FARA provides a 3.1x throughput improvement in comparison to frequency-oblivious systems that occupy the same spectrum.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll22" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll22',22)">expand</a>

The inherent tradeoff between multicasting and beamforming -- the broadcast advantage of low-gain omni-directional transmissions versus the high-gain but spatially restricted transmissions of beamforming antennas -- makes this problem especially challenging.</p> <p>In this paper, we design and evaluate optimal algorithms, and easy-to-implement greedy algorithms with performance guarantees, that generate and schedule efficient beam patterns for multicast transmissions. These algorithms are built upon the novel usage of composite beams that provide a knob to control the operating point of the tradeoff curve. This is in contrast to the sub-optimal usage of either purely directional or omni-directional beams by existing schemes. We further consider two models for composite beam pattern generation: one in which transmit power is (a) equally split, and (b) asymmetrically split between the constituent main lobes. A systematic evaluation, using real world traces obtained from measurements using an eight element switched beamforming antenna in an indoor office environment, indicates significant gains of about four folds over omni and two folds over prior art schemes.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll23" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll23',23)">expand</a>

It makes the case for using a two-tier hybrid wireless/wired architecture to interconnect hundreds to thousands of cores in chip multiprocessors (CMPs), where current interconnect technologies face severe scaling limitations in excessive latency, long wiring, and complex layout. We propose a recursive wireless interconnect structure called the WCube that features a single transmit antenna and multiple receive antennas at each micro wireless router and offers scalable performance in terms of latency and connectivity. We show the feasibility to build miniature on-chip antennas, and simple transmitters and receivers that operate at 100-500 GHz sub-terahertz frequency bands. We also devise new two-tier wormhole based routing algorithms that are deadlock free and ensure a minimum-latency route on a 1000-core on-chip interconnect network. Our simulations show that our protocol suite can reduce the observed latency by 20% to 45%, and consumes power that is comparable to or less than current 2-D wired mesh designs.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide26" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wi-fi standards have provisions for multiple orthogonal channels where the orthogonality allows them to be used simultaneously both in time and frequency without interference concerns. In this paper, we pose the following question: <i>Can devices use the multiple orthogonal channels in wi-fi networks simultaneously to realize a high data-rate wireless link and hence cater to applications requiring high bandwidths?</i> In other words, given that there are 3 orthogonal wi-fi channels in the 2.4GHz band and 12 orthogonal wi-fi channels in the 5GHz band, can a pair of devices each equipped with 15 wi-fi radios use all the available orthogonal channels to achieve a high data-rate link operating at 600Mbps? Surprisingly, we find through experimental evaluation that the actual observed performance when using all fifteen orthogonal channels between two devices is a mere <i>91Mbps</i>. We identify the reasons behind the low performance and present Glia, a software only solution that effectively exercises all available radios. We prototype Glia and show using experimental evaluations that Glia helps achieve close to 600Mbps data-rate when using all possible wi-fi channels.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Body Area Networks (BANs) can perform the task of continuous, remote monitoring of a patient's physiological signals in diverse environments. Apart from providing healthcare professionals with extensive logs of a patient's physiological history, BANs can be used to identify and react to emergency situations. We identify three important factors that afflict wireless communication in BANs: impermeability of the human body to radio waves at frequencies commonly used in BANs, efficient operation in mobile and time-varying environments, and mission-critical requirements for quick response to emergencies. An understanding of the link layer behavior of wireless sensor nodes placed on the body is crucial to address these and other challenges such as reducing energy consumption and increasing network lifetime.</p> <p>In this paper, we investigate link layer behavior by placing nodes on the body and directly measuring metrics of interest to engineers such as packet delivery ratio (PDR) and RSSI. Emulating a possible real-life BAN operating at the 2.4 <i>GHz</i> band with 12 sensor nodes, we collect over 80 hours of data from 14 volunteers in $3$ different environments that BANs are expected to operate in. We analyze the data to reveal several link layer characteristics to provide insight and guidelines for the designing of BANs. We also evaluate the performance of common routing metrics on our data.</p> <p>Our analysis helps us make the following conclusions. Link PDR is highly affected by the environment and not significantly by the volunteer for the experiment. Routing between nodes on the same side of the body is preferred to routing between nodes on the opposite sides. For links with the same source, failure of packet transmission to a certain node, in some cases, implies the increased probability of reception for other nodes. Most errors occur in bursts of length 1, but a small fraction occur in longer periods ($40$ packets or more).</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide28" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents the design challenges posed by a new class of ultra-low-power devices referred to as Energy-Harvesting Active Networked Tags (EnHANTs). EnHANTs are small, flexible, and self-reliant (in terms of energy devices that can be attached to objects that are traditionally not networked (e.g., books, clothing, and produce), thereby providing the infrastructure for various novel tracking applications. Examples of these applications include locating misplaced items, continuous monitoring of objects (items in a store, boxes in transit), and determining locations of disaster survivors. Recent advances in ultra-low-power wireless communications, ultra-wideband (UWB) circuit design, and organic electronic harvesting techniques will enable the realization of EnHANTs in the near future. In order for EnHANTs to rely on harvested energy, they have to spend significantly less energy than Bluetooth, Zigbee, and IEEE 802.15.4a devices. Moreover, the harvesting components and the ultra-low-power physical layer have special characteristics whose implications on the higher layers have yet to be studied (e.g., when using ultra-low-power circuits, the energy required to receive a bit is an order of magnitude higher than the energy required to transmit a bit). These special characteristics pose several new cross-layer research problems. In this paper, we describe the design challenges at the layers above the physical layer, point out relevant research directions, and outline possible starting points for solutions.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide30" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>A growing number of mobile computing applications are centered around the user's location. The notion of location is broad, ranging from physical coordinates (latitude/longitude) to logical labels (like Starbucks, McDonalds). While extensive research has been performed in physical localization, there have been few attempts in recognizing logical locations. This paper argues that the increasing number of sensors on mobile phones presents new opportunities for logical localization. We postulate that ambient sound, light, and color in a place convey a photo-acoustic signature that can be sensed by the phone's camera and microphone. In-built accelerometers in some phones may also be useful in inferring broad classes of user-motion, often dictated by the nature of the place. By combining these optical, acoustic, and motion attributes, it may be feasible to construct an identifiable fingerprint for logical localization. Hence, users in adjacent stores can be separated logically, even when their physical positions are extremely close. We propose <i>SurroundSense,</i> a mobile phone based system that explores logical localization via ambience fingerprinting. Evaluation results from 51 different stores show that SurroundSense can achieve an average accuracy of 87% when all sensing modalities are employed. We believe this is an encouraging result, opening new possibilities in indoor localization.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide31" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>System virtualization is now available for mobile devices allowing for many advantages. Two of the major benefits from virtualization are system fault isolation and security. The isolated driver domain (IDD) model, a widely adopted architecture, enables strong system fault isolation by limiting the impact of driver faults to the driver domain itself. However, excessive I/O requests from a malicious domain to an IDD can cause CPU overuse of the IDD and performance degradation of applications in the IDD and other domains that share the same I/O device with the malicious do-main. If the IDD model is applied to mobile devices, this failure of performance isolation could also lead to battery drain, and thus it introduces a new severe threat to mobile devices. In order to solve this problem, we propose a fine-grained I/O access control mechanism in an IDD. Requests from guest domains are managed by an accounting module in terms of CPU usage, with the calcula-tion of estimated CPU consumption using regression equations. The requests are scheduled by an I/O access control enforcer ac-cording to security policies. As a result, our mechanism provides precise control on the CPU usage of a guest domain due to I/O device access, and prevents malicious guest domains from CPU overuse, performance degradation, and battery drain. We have implemented a prototype of our approach considering both network and storage devices with a real smart phone (SGH-i780) that runs two para-virtualized Linux kernels on top of Secure Xen on ARM. The evaluation shows our approach effectively protects a smart phone against excessive I/O attacks and guarantees availability.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll31" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll31',31)">expand</a>

In order for these systems to remain scalable it has been proposed to aggregate the information within the network as it travels from the sources to the destinations. However, so far it has remained unclear by what amount the aggregation scheme needs to reduce the original data in order to be considered scalable. In this paper we prove formally that any suitable aggregation scheme must reduce the bandwidth at which information about an area at distance <i>d</i> is provided to the cars asymptotically faster than 1/<i>d</i><sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, we constructively show that this bound is tight: for any arbitrary ε&gt;0, there exists a scalable aggregation scheme that reduces information asymptotically like 1/<i>d</i><sup>(2+ε)</sup>.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide33" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Enterprise WLANs have made a dramatic shift towards centralized architectures in the recent past. The reasons for such a change have been ease of management and better design of various control and security functions. The data path of WLANs, however, continues to use the distributed, random-access model, as defined by the popular DCF mechanism of the 802.11 standard. While theoretical results indicate that a centrally scheduled data path can achieve higher efficiency than its distributed counterpart, the likely complexity of such a solution has inhibited practical consideration. In this paper, we take a fresh, implementation and deployment oriented, view in understanding data path choices in enterprise WLANs. We perform extensive measurements to characterize the impact of various design choices, like scheduling granularity on the performance of a centralized scheduler, and identify regions where such a centralized scheduler can provide the best gains.</p> <p>Our detailed evaluation with scheduling prototypes deployed on two different wireless testbeds indicates that DCF is quite robust in many scenarios, but centralization can play a unique role in 1) mitigating hidden terminals - scenarios which may occur infrequently, but become pain points when they do and 2) exploiting exposed terminals - scenarios which occur more frequently, and limit the potential of successful concurrent transmissions. Motivated by these results, we design and implement CENTAUR - a hybrid data path for enterprise WLANs, that combines the simplicity and ease of DCF with a limited amount of centralized scheduling from a unique vantage point. Our mechanisms do not require client cooperation and can support legacy 802.11 clients.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide35" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless mesh networks are being used to provide Internet access in a cost efficient manner. Typically, consumer-level wireless access points with modified software are used to route traffic to potentially multiple back-haul points. Malware infected computers generate malicious traffic, which uses valuable network resources and puts other systems at risk. Intrusion detection systems can be used to detect such activity. Cost constraints and the decentralised nature of WMNs make performing intrusion detection on mesh devices desirable. However, these devices are typically resource constrained. This paper describes the results of examining their ability to perform intrusion detection. Our experimental study shows that commonly-used deep packet inspection approaches are unreliable on such hardware. We implement a set of lightweight anomaly detection mechanisms as part of an intrusion detection system, called OpenLIDS. We show that even with the limited hardware resources of a mesh device, it can detect current malware behaviour in an efficient way.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and settings. Our experimental results show that (i) in certain environments, due to lack of variations in the wireless channel, the extracted bits have very low entropy making these bits unsuitable for a secret key, (ii) an adversary can cause predictable key generation in these static environments, and (iii) in dynamic scenarios where the two devices are mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the environment, high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the strengths of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an environment adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive lossy quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation [7] and privacy amplification [14]. Our measurements show that our scheme, in comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in terms of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key bit streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the NIST test suite [21] that we conduct.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll36" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll36',36)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We consider the problem of localizing wireless nodes in an outdoor, open-space environment, using ad-hoc radio ranging measurements, e.g., 802.11. We cast these ranging measurements as a set of distance constraints, thus forming an over-determined system of equations suitable for non-linear least squares optimization. However, ranging measurements are often subject to errors, induced by multipath signals and variations in path loss, unreliable hardware or antenna connectors, or imperfection in measurement models. Such potentially large, non-Gaussian errors in the measurement data ultimately produce inaccurate localization solutions. We propose a new error-tolerant localization method, called <i>snap-inducing shaped residuals</i> (SISR), to identify automatically "bad nodes" and "bad links" arising from these errors, so that they receive less weight in the localization process. In particular, SISR snaps "good nodes" to their accurate locations and gives less emphasis to other nodes. While the mathematical techniques used by SISR are similar to robust statistics, SISR's exploitation of the <i>snap-in</i> effect in localization appears to be novel. We provide analysis on the principle of SISR, illustrate errors in real-world measurements, and demonstrate a working SISR implementation in field experiments on a testbed of 37 wireless nodes, as well as show the superior performance of SISR in simulation with a larger number of nodes.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>
