<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Laptops are vulnerable to theft, greatly increasing the likelihood of exposing sensitive files. Unfortunately, storing data in a cryptographic file system does not fully address this problem. Such systems ask the user to imbue them with long-term authority for decryption, but that authority can be used by anyone who physically possesses the machine. Forcing the user to frequently reestablish his identity is intrusive, encouraging him to disable encryption.Our solution to this problem is <i>Zero-Interaction Authentication</i>, or ZIA. In ZIA, a user wears a small <i>authentication token</i> that communicates with a laptop over a short-range, wireless link. Whenever the laptop needs decryption authority, it acquires it from the token; authority is retained only as long as necessary. With careful key management, ZIA imposes an overhead of only 9.3% for representative workloads. The largest file cache on our hardware can be re-encrypted within five seconds of the user's departure, and restored in just over six seconds after detecting the user's return. This secures the machine before an attacker can gain physical access, but recovers full performance before a returning user resumes work.</div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The IEEE 802.11 wireless media access standard supports multiple data rates at the physical layer. Moreover, various auto rate adaptation mechanisms at the medium access layer have been proposed to utilize this multi-rate capability by automatically adapting the transmission rate to best match the channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Opportunistic Auto Rate (OAR) protocol to better exploit durations of high-quality channels conditions. The key mechanism of the OAR protocol is to opportunistically send multiple back-to-back data packets whenever the channel quality is good. As channel coherence times typically exceed multiple packet transmission times for both mobile and non-mobile users, OAR achieves significant throughput gains as compared to state-of-the-art auto-rate adaptation mechanisms. Moreover, over longer time scales, OAR ensures that all nodes are granted channel access for the same time-shares as achieved by single-rate IEEE 802.11. We describe mechanisms to implement OAR on top of any existing auto-rate adaptation scheme in a nearly IEEE 802.11 compliant manner. We also analytically study OAR and characterize the gains in throughput as a function of the channel conditions. Finally, we perform an extensive set of <i>ns-2</i> simulations to study the impact of such factors as node velocity, channel conditions, and topology on the throughput of OAR.</div></span> <a id="expcoll7" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll7',7)">expand</a>

Several researchers have proposed a simple modification of IEEE 802.11 to incorporate power control. The main idea of these power control schemes is to use different power levels for RTS-CTS and DATA-ACK. Specifically, maximum transmit power is used for RTS-CTS, and the minimum required transmit power is used for DATA-ACK transmissions in order to save energy. However, we show that this scheme can degrade network throughput and can result in higher energy consumption than using IEEE 802.11 without power control. We propose an improved power control protocol which does not degrade throughput and yields energy saving.</div></span> <a id="expcoll8" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll8',8)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Directional antennas can adaptively select radio signals of interest in specific directions, while filtering out unwanted interference from other directions. Although a couple of medium access protocols based on random access schemes have been proposed for networks with directional antennas, they suffer from high probability of collisions because of their dependence on omnidirectional mode for the transmission or reception of control packets in order to establish directional links. We propose a distributed receiver-oriented multiple access (ROMA) channel access scheduling protocol for ad hoc networks with directional antennas, each of which can form multiple beams and commence several simultaneous communication sessions. Unlike random access schemes that use on-demand handshakes or signal scanning to resolve communication targets, ROMA determines a number of links for activation in every time slot using only two-hop topology information. It is shown that significant improvements on network throughput and delay can be achieved by exploiting the multi-beam forming capability of directional antennas in both transmission and reception. The performance of ROMA is studied by simulations, and compared with a well-know static scheduling scheme that is based on global topology information.</div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

 <span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Previous research in wireless ad hoc networks typically assumes the use of omnidirectional antennas at all nodes. With omnidirectional antennas, while two nodes are communicating using a given channel, MAC protocols such as IEEE 802.11 require all other nodes in the vicinity to stay silent. With directional antennas, two pairs of nodes located in each other's vicinity may potentially communicate simultaneously, depending on the directions of transmission. This can increase spatial reuse of the wireless channel. In addition, the higher gain of directional antennas allows a node to communicate with other nodes located far away, implying that messages could be delivered to the destination in fewer hops. In this paper, we propose a MAC protocol that exploits the characteristics of directional antennas. Our design focuses on using multi-hop RTSs to establish links between distant nodes, and then transmit CTS, DATA and ACK over a single hop. Results show that our directional MAC protocol can perform better than IEEE 802.11, although we find that the performance is dependent on the topology configuration and the flow patterns in the system.</div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Wireless link losses result in poor TCP throughput since losses are perceived as congestion by TCP, resulting in source throttling. In order to mitigate this effect, 3G wireless link designers have augmented their system with extensive local retransmission mechanisms. In addition, in order to increase throughput, intelligent channel state based scheduling have also been introduced. While these mechanisms have reduced the impact of losses on TCP throughput and improved the channel utilization, these gains have come at the expense of increased delay and rate variability. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the impact of variable rate and variable delay on long-lived TCP performance. We propose a model to explain and predict TCP's throughput over a link with variable rate and/or delay. We also propose a network-based solution called <i>Ack Regulator</i> that mitigates the effect of variable rate and/or delay without significantly increasing the round trip time, while improving TCP performance by up to 40%.</div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Due to the availability of a wide variety of wireless access technologies, a mobile host can potentially have subscriptions and access to more than one wireless network at a given time. In this paper, we consider such a multi-homed mobile host, and address the problem of achieving bandwidth aggregation by striping data across the multiple interfaces of the mobile host. We show that both link layer striping approaches and application layer techniques that stripe data across multiple TCP sockets do not achieve the optimal bandwidth aggregation due to a variety of factors specific to wireless networks. We propose an end-to-end transport layer approach called <i>pTCP</i> that effectively performs bandwidth aggregation on multi homed mobile hosts. We show through simulations that pTCP achieves the desired goals under a variety of network conditions.</div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We present two systems, reliable sockets (rocks) and reliable packets (racks), that provide transparent network connection mobility using only user- level mechanisms. Each system can detect a connection failure within seconds of its occurrence, preserve the endpoint of a failed connection in a suspended state for an arbitrary period of time, and automatically reconnect, even when one end of the connection changes IP address, with correct recovery of in-flight data. To allow rocks and racks to interoperate with ordinary clients and servers, we introduce a general user-level Enhancement Detection Protocol that enables the remote detection of rocks and racks, or any other socket enhancement system, but does not affect applications that use ordinary sockets. Rocks and racks provide the same functionality but have different implementation models: rocks intercept and modify the behavior of the sockets API by using an interposed library, while racks uses a packet filter to intercept and modify the packets exchanged over a connection. Racks and rocks introduce small throughput and latency overheads that we deem acceptable for the level of mobility and reliability they provide.</div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

This paper presents results from the largest and most comprehensive trace of network activity in a large, production wireless LAN. For eleven weeks we traced the activity of nearly two thousand users drawn from a general campus population, using a campus-wide network of 476 access points spread over 161 buildings. Our study expands on those done by Tang and Baker, with a significantly larger and broader population.We found that residential traffic dominated all other traffic, particularly in residences populated by newer students; students are increasingly choosing a wireless laptop as their primary computer. Although web protocols were the single largest component of traffic volume, network backup and file sharing contributed an unexpectedly large amount to the traffic. Although there was some roaming within a network session, we were surprised by the number of situations in which cards roamed excessively, unable to settle on one access point. Cross-subnet roams were an especial problem, because they broke IP connections, indicating the need for solutions that avoid or accommodate such roams.</div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">On many battery-powered mobile computing devices, the wireless network is a significant contributor to the total energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between energy-saving protocols and TCP performance for Web like transfers. We show that the popular IEEE 802.11 power-saving mode (PSM), a "static" protocol, can harm performance by increasing fast round trip times (RTTs) to 100 ms; and that under typical Web browsing workloads, current implementations will unnecessarily spend energy waking up during long idle periods.To overcome these problems, we present the <i>Bounded-Slowdown (BSD) protocol</i>, a PSM that dynamically adapts to network activity. BSD is an optimal solution to the problem of minimizing energy consumption while guaranteeing that a connection's RTT does not increase by more than a factor p over its base RTT, where p is a protocol parameter that exposes the trade-off between minimizing energy and reducing latency. works by staying awake for a short period of time after the link idle. We present several trace-driven simulation results that show that, compared to a static PSM, the Bounded Slowdown protocol reduces average Web page retrieval times by 5--64%, while <i>simultaneously</i> reducing energy consumption by 1--14% (and by 13X compared to no power management).</div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The growing popularity of IEEE 802.11 has made wireless LAN a potential candidate technology for providing high speed wireless access services. Also, by supporting Mobile IP, wireless LAN can meet demands for expanded wireless access coverage while maintaining continuous connectivity from one wireless LAN to another. In the Mobile IP procedure, mobile node movement can be detected from advertisements of foreign agents that differ from the previously received advertisement and the new "care-of" address is registered with the home agent. However, user packets are not forwarded to the new foreign agent until registration is completed and this interruption may degrade the quality of service especially in real-time applications such as audio and video or may lower the TCP throughput due to retransmission timeout. To tackle these issues, we propose a new low latency handoff method, where access points used in a wireless LAN environment and a dedicated MAC bridge are jointly used to alleviate packet loss without altering the Mobile IP specifications. In this paper, we present the design architecture of the proposed method and evaluate its performance in an actual network environment to verify the effectiveness of our approach.</div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

The main idea we explore in this paper is that of jointly compressing the data generated by different nodes as this information travels over multiple hops, to eliminate correlations in the representation of the sampled field. Our main contributions are: (a) we obtain, using simple network flow concepts, conditions on the rate/distortion function of the random field, so as to guarantee that any node can obtain the measurements collected at every other node in the network, quantized to within any prescribed distortion value; and (b), we construct a large class of physically-motivated stochastic models for sensor data, for which we are able to prove that the joint rate/distortion function of all the data generated by the whole network grows slower than the bounds found in (a). A truly novel aspect of our work is the tight coupling between routing and source coding, explicitly formulated in a simple and analytically tractable model---to the best of our knowledge, this connection had not been studied before.</div></span> <a id="expcoll23" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll23',23)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Sink mobility brings new challenges to large-scale sensor networking. It suggests that information about each mobile sink's location be continuously propagated through the sensor field to keep all sensor nodes updated with the direction of forwarding future data reports. Unfortunately frequent location updates from multiple sinks can lead to both excessive drain of sensors' limited battery power supply and increased collisions in wireless transmissions. In this paper we describe <i>TTDD</i>, a <i>Two-Tier Data Dissemination</i> approach that provides scalable and efficient data delivery to multiple mobile sinks. Each data source in TTDD proactively builds a grid structure which enables mobile sinks to continuously receive data on the move by flooding queries within a local cell only. TTDD's design exploits the fact that sensor nodes are stationary and location-aware to construct and maintain the grid structures with low overhead. We have evaluated TTDD performance through both analysis and extensive simulation experiments. Our results show that TTDD handles multiple mobile sinks efficiently with performance comparable with that of stationary sinks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The demand for an all-in-one phone with integrated personal information management and data access capabilities is beginning to accelerate. While personal digital assistants (PDAs) with built-in cellular, WiFi, and Voice-Over-IP technologies have the ability to serve these needs in a single package, the rate at which energy is consumed by PDA-based phones is very high. Thus, these devices can quickly drain their own batteries and become useless to their owner.In this paper, we introduce a technique to increase the battery lifetime of a PDA-based phone by reducing its <i>idle power</i>, the power a device consumes in a "standby" state. To reduce the idle power, we essentially shut down the device and its wireless network card when the device is not being used---the device is powered only when an incoming call is received. Using this technique, we can increase the battery lifetime by up to 115%.In this paper, we describe the design of our "wake-on-wireless" energy-saving strategy and the prototype device we implemented. To evaluate our technique, we compare it with alternative approaches. Our results show that our technique can provide a significant lifetime improvement over other technologies.</div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide28" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In all-wireless networks a crucial problem is to minimize energy consumption, as in most cases the nodes are battery-operated. We focus on the problem of power-optimal broadcast, for which it is well known that the broadcast nature of the radio transmission can be exploited to optimize energy consumption. Several authors have conjectured that the problem of power-optimal broadcast is NP-complete. We provide here a formal proof, both for the general case and for the geometric one; in the former case, the network topology is represented by a generic graph with arbitrary weights, whereas in the latter a Euclidean distance is considered. We then describe a new heuristic, Embedded Wireless Multicast Advantage. We show that it compares well with other proposals and we explain how it can be distributed.</div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Cooperative cell-based strategies have been recently proposed as a technique for extending the lifetime of wireless ad hoc networks, while only slightly impacting network performance. The effectiveness of this approach depends heavily on the node density: the higher it is, the more consistent energy savings can potentially be achieved. However, no general analyses of network lifetime have been done either for a base network (one without any energy conservation technique) or for one using cooperative energy conservation strategies. In this paper, we investigate the lifetime/density tradeoff under the hypothesis that nodes are distributed uniformly at random in a given region, and that the traffic is evenly distributed across the network. We also analyze the case where the node density is just sufficient to ensure that the network is connected with high probability. This analysis, which is supported by the results of extensive simulations, shows that even in this low density scenario, cell-based strategies can significantly extend network lifetime.</div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide32" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We present a framework for resource control in CDMA networks carrying elastic traffic, considering both the uplink and the downlink direction. The framework is based on microeconomics and congestion pricing, and seeks to exploit the joint control of the transmission rate and the signal quality in order to achieve efficient utilization of network resources, in a distributed and decentralized manner. An important feature of the framework is that it incorporates both the congestion for shared resources in wireless and wired networks, and the cost of battery power at mobile hosts. We prove that for elastic traffic, where users value only their average throughput, the user's net utility maximization problem can be decomposed into two simpler problems: one involving the selection of the optimal signal quality, and one involving the selection of the optimal transmission rate. Based on this result, the selection of signal quality can be performed as done today using outer loop power control, while rate adaptation can be integrated with rate adaptation at the transport layer.</div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide33" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper we compute the uplink capacity of power-control CDMA mobile networks with an idealized power control, that contain best-effort type applications, i.e. applications whose transmission rate can be controlled. An arriving best-effort call is assumed to have a fixed amount of traffic to send, so the transmission rate assigned to it determines the duration of the call. We allow for multi-services (so that mobile stations have different quality of service requirements). Unlike some previous published work where soft blocking was considered (and the system was thus allowed to operate beyond capacity), we assume that a call admission mechanism is implemented in order to prevent a new call to arrive when the system is already saturated. This guarantees the quality of service of ongoing calls. Our first result is that slowing the transmission rates in the case of a single cell with homogeneous quality of service characteristics increases capacity. This suggests that there is a limit capacity that can be approached when slowing down the transmission rates. We identify this limit and show that it has the following property: as long as the arrival rate of information is below some level, blocking probability can become arbitrarily small by sufficiently slowing down the transmission rates. We then extend the results to the general heterogeneous and multi-cell case.</div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide34" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">This work considers the problem of designing an efficient and low-cost infrastructure for connecting static multi-hop wireless networks with wired backbone, while ensuring QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay. This infrastructure is useful for designing low cost and fast deployed access networks in rural and suburban areas. It may also be used for providing access to sensor networks or for efficient facility placement in wireless networks. In these networks some nodes are chosen as access points and function as gateways to access a wired backbone. Each access point serves a cluster of its nearby user and a spanning tree rooted at the access point is used for message delivery. The work addresses both the design optimization and the operation aspects of the system. From the design perspective, we seek for a partition of the network nodes into minimal number of disjoint clusters that satisfy multiple constraints; Each cluster is required to be a connected graph with an upper bound on its radius. We assume that each node has a weight (representing its bandwidth requirement) and the total weight of all cluster nodes is also bounded. We show that these clustering requirements can be formulated as an instance of the Capacitated Facility Location problem (CFLP) with additional constraints. By breaking the problem into two sub-problems and solving each one separately, we propose polynomial time approximation algorithms that calculate solutions within a constant factor of the optimal ones. From the operation viewpoint, we introduce an adaptive delivery mechanism that maximizes the throughput of each cluster without violating the QoS constraints.</div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">A key subproblem in the construction of location-aware systems is the determination of the position of a mobile device. This paper describes the design, implementation and analysis of a system for determining position inside a building from measured RF signal strengths of packets on an IEEE 802.11b wireless Ethernet network. Previous approaches to location awareness with RF signals have been severely hampered by non-linearity, noise and complex correlations due to multi-path effects, interference and absorption. The design of our system begins with the observation that determining position from complex, noisy and non-linear signals is a well-studied problem in the field of robotics. Using only off-the-shelf hardware, we achieve robust position estimation to within a meter in our experimental context and after adequate training of our system. We can also coarsely determine our orientation and can track our position as we move. By applying recent advances in probabilistic inference of position and sensor fusion from noisy signals, we show that the RF emissions from base stations as measured by off-the-shelf wireless Ethernet cards are sufficiently rich in information to permit a mobile device to reliably track its location.</div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">As of now, it is not uncommon for one to use multiple computers in separate places such as at home, office or school. A number of applications currently exist to allow a user to easily access and control these computers remotely via a notebook computer or web page. Unfortunately, even with such solutions, it is rather inconvenient, for example, to try accessing your computer while walking downtown or riding a train. On the other hand, considering that cellular phones have been accepted as multi-function devices capable of karaoke, digital photography and web browsing in countries like Japan, it may prove beneficial to support remote PC access on a cellular phone. With this in mind, we created Rajicon, a system to provide an easy to use interface to remotely operate a PC's GUI operating system via a cellular phone. Rajicon supports image based navigation of a remote PC's desktop and mouse/key operations. In addition, Rajicon provides functions for keyboard shortcuts, specialized window adjustment operations and text extraction. We have performed extensive evaluations with five subjects and discuss the results in this paper. We also discuss the lead author's latest adaption of Rajicon to a PDA.</div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

These environmental impacts will come under increasing government and consumer scrutiny, and like other disciplines (e.g. architecture, transportation), pervasive computing will have to adapt accordingly. Further, we argue that software-related issues will play an increasing role in reducing the environmental impact of computing. We thus propose that an important challenge for pervasive computing is to develop research in new architectures, design methodologies, metrics, algorithms and operating systems to minimize these impacts. We then discuss specific research issues and questions that arise in three phases of the device lifecycle: minimizing resource usage for manufacture and operation, maximizing device lifetime, and improving recyclability.</div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide43" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">One application domain the mobile computing community has not yet entered is that of grid computing -- the aggregation of network-connected computers to form a large-scale, distributed system used to tackle complex scientific or commercial problems. In this paper we present the challenge of harvesting the increasingly widespread availability of Internet connected wireless mobile devices such as PDAs and laptops to be beneficially used within the emerging national and global computational grid. The integration of mobile wireless consumer devices into the Grid initially seems unlikely due to the inherent limitations typical of mobile devices, such as reduced CPU performance, small secondary storage, heightened battery consumption sensitivity, and unreliable low-bandwidth communication. However, the millions of laptops and PDAs sold annually suggest that this untapped abundance should not be prematurely dismissed. Given that the benefits of combining the resources of mobile devices with the computational grid are potentially enormous, one must compensate for the inherent limitations of these devices in order to successfully utilise them in the Grid. In this paper we identify the research challenges arising from this problem and propose our vision of a potential architectural solution. We suggest a proxy based, clustered system architecture with favourable deployment, interoperability, scalability, adaptivity, and fault-tolerance characteristics as well as an economic model to stimulate future research in this emerging field.</div></span> <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll43',43)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide44" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Interoperability among a group of devices, applications, and services is typically predicated on those entities having some degree of prior knowledge of each another. In general, they must be written to understand the type of thing with which they will interact, including the details of communication as well as semantic knowledge such as when and how to communicate. This paper presents a case for "recombinant computing" -- a set of common interaction patterns that leverage mobile code to allow rich interactions among computational entities with only limited a priori knowledge of one another. We have been experimenting with a particular embodiment of these ideas, which we call Speakeasy. It is designed to support ad hoc, end user configurations of hardware and software, and provides patterns for data exchange, user control, discovery of new services and devices, and contextual awareness.</div></span> <a id="expcoll44" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll44',44)">expand</a>
