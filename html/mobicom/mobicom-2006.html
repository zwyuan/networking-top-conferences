In the 1980's analog FDMA served a small mostly North American base of wireless telephony users. The 1990's witnessed the start of widespread worldwide digital telephony and limited data service, categorized as 2<sup>nd</sup> Generation, employing two conflicting technologies, TDMA and CDMA. The first decade of the new century brought full wireless data and Internet connectivity with two competing 3<sup>rd</sup> Generation CDMA implementations: CDMA2000 and WCDMA. For the second decade beginning in 2010, early indications point to convergence upon a single 4<sup>th</sup> Generation high speed data technology, OFDMA, generally referred to as Mobile WiMax for which a standard 802.16e has recently been adopted. After describing this historical evolution, we shall address the challenges and opportunities of both 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> Generation Wireless Broadband service.</div></span> <a id="expcoll1" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll1',1)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Wireless mesh networks are expected to be widely used to provide Internet access in the near future. In order to fulfill the expectations, these networks should provide high throughput simultaneously to many users. Recent research has indicated that, due to its conservative CSMA/CA channel access scheme and RTS/CTS mechanism, 802.11 is not suitable to achieve this goal.In this paper, we investigate throughput improvements achievable by replacing CSMA/CA with an STDMA scheme where transmissions are scheduled according to the physical interference model. To this end, we present a computationally efficient heuristic for computing a feasible schedule under the physical interference model and we prove, under uniform random node distribution, an approximation factor for the length of this schedule relative to the shortest schedule possible with physical interference. This represents the first known polynomial-time algorithm for this problem with a proven approximation factor.We also evaluate the throughput and execution time of this algorithm on representative wireless mesh network scenarios through packet-level simulations. The results show that throughput with STDMA and physical-interference-based scheduling can be up to three times higher than 802.11 for the parameter values simulated. The results also show that our scheduling algorithm can schedule networks with 2000 nodes in about 2.5 minutes.</div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper, we consider the problem of mitigating interference and improving network capacity in wireless mesh networks from the angle of <i>temporal-spatial diversity</i>. In a nutshell, while the achievable throughput on a multihop wireless path is limited by intra-flow interference, the overall capacity of a multihop wireless network can be increased by exploiting temporal-spatial diversity of concurrent transmissions that exist among a number of wireless links. Connections that are routed along multihop wireless paths can be scheduled to take place simultaneously if their transmissions do not interfere with each other (significantly).To make a case of exploiting the temporal-spatial diversity to improve network capacity, we focus on transporting <i> downstream</i> traffic at gateway nodes with Internet access. We propose to construct, based on measurements of received signal strengths, a <i>virtual coordinate system</i> that is used to determine the sets of paths along which transmissions can take place with the least inter-flow interference. Based on the sets of non-interfering paths, the gateway node then determines the order with which a gateway node schedules frames of different connections to be transmitted. Through extensive simulation (with real-life measurement traces on an operational, city-wide wireless community network), we show that the downstream throughput of a gateway node in a wireless mesh network can be improved by 10-35% under a variety of network topologies and traffic distributions. This, coupled with the fact that the proposed approach requires only minor code change in the gateway nodes and does not require any additional hardware, makes it a viable option to improving network capacity in existing wireless mesh networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">This paper considers the interaction between channel assignment and distributed scheduling in multi-channel multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs). Recently, a number of distributed scheduling algorithms for wireless networks have emerged. Due to their distributed operation, these algorithms can achieve <i>only a fraction</i> of the maximum possible throughput. As an alternative to increasing the throughput fraction by designing new algorithms, in this paper we present a novel approach that takes advantage of the inherent multi-radio capability of WMNs. We show that this capability can enable <i>partitioning</i> of the network into subnetworks in which <i>simple distributed scheduling algorithms can achieve 100% throughput</i>. The partitioning is based on the recently introduced notion of Local Pooling. Using this notion, we characterize topologies in which 100% throughput can be achieved distributedly. These topologies are used in order to develop a number of channel assignment algorithms that are based on a matroid intersection algorithm. These algorithms partition a network in a manner that not only expands the capacity regions of the subnetworks but also allows distributed algorithms to achieve these capacity regions. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulation and show that they significantly increase the <i>distributedly achievable</i> capacity region.</div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">This paper presents a highly efficient and accurate link-quality measurement framework, called EAR (<i>Efficient and Accurate link-quality monito</i>R), for multi-hop wireless mesh networks, that has several salient features. First, it exploits three complementary measurement schemes: passive, cooperative, and active monitoring. EAR maximizes the measurement accuracy by (i) dynamically and adaptively adopting one of these schemes and (ii) opportunistically exploiting the <i> nicast</i> application traffic present in the network, while minimizing the measurement overhead. Second, EAR effectively identifies the existence of wireless link asymmetry by measuring the quality of each link in both <i>directions</i> of the link, thus improving the utilization of network capacity by up to 114%. Finally, its reliance on both the network layer and the IEEE 802.11-based device driver solutions makes EAR easily deployable in existing multi-hop wireless mesh networks without system recompilation or MAC firmware modification. EAR has been evaluated extensively via both <i>ns</i>-2-based simulation and experimentation on our Linux-based implementation. Both simulation and experimentation results have shown EAR to provide highly accurate link-quality measurements with minimum overhead.</div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide8" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The impressive penetration of 802.11-based wireless networks in many metropolitan areas around the world offers, for the first time, the opportunity of a "grassroots" wireless Internet service provided by users who "open up" their 802.11 (Wi-Fi) access points in a controlled manner to mobile clients. While there are many business, legal, and policy issues to be ironed out for this vision to become reality, we are concerned in this paper with an important technical question surrounding such a system: can such an unplanned network service provide reasonable performance to network clients moving in cars at vehicular speeds.To answer this question, we present the results of a measurement study carried out over 290 "drive hours" over a few cars under typical driving conditions, in and around the Boston metropolitan area (some of our data also comes from a car in Seattle). With a simple caching optimization to speed-up IP address acquisition, we find that for our driving patterns the median duration of link-layer connectivity at vehicular speeds is 13 seconds, the median connection upload bandwidth is 30 KBytes/s, and that the mean duration between successful associations to APs is 75 seconds. We also find that connections are equally probable across a range of urban speeds (up to 60 km/hour in our measurements). Our end-to-end TCP upload experiments had a median throughput of about 30 KBytes/s, which is consistent with typical uplink speeds of home broadband links in the US. The median TCP connection is capable of uploading about 216 KBytes of data.Our high-level conclusion is that grassroots Wi-Fi networks are viable for a variety of applications, particularly ones that can tolerate intermittent connectivity. We discuss how our measurement results can improve transport protocols in such networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll8" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll8',8)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Packet-level diversity, or distributing packet transmissions over multiple, diverse channels, offers benefits in improving communication performance and robustness to channel variations. Previous works have analyzed and quantified those benefits, and developed transmission policies to realize them. However, translating those benefits into practice still faces numerous challenges from uncertainty in the adequacy of the channel models used to develop policies, to implementation dificulties in realizing the precise transmission schedules they mandate. This work is a first step in assessing what remains of those benefits once confronted with such practical challenges. Our investigation is carried out over an 802.11 testbed, where diversity is realized through the different frequency bands available for transmissions between hosts and access points. We use the testbed to evaluate the impact of transmission policies, channel characteristics, channel correlation, and various end-system constraints that affect our ability to precisely control transmissions timing. Our investigation reveals that in spite of the many gaps that exist between theory and practice, packet-level diversity still provides a simple solution to improve transmission performance and robustness across a broad range of configurations.</div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (a)we present a detailed performance study of a set of long-distance 802.11b links at various layers of the network stack, and (b)we document the various non-obvious experiences during our study.Our study includes eight long-distance links, ranging from 1km to 37km in length. Unlike prior studies of outdoor 802.11 links, we find that the error rate as a function of the received signal strength behaves close to theory. Time correlation of any packet errors is negligible across a range of time-scales. We have observed at least one of the link to be robust to rain and fog. But any interference on the long-distance links can be detrimental to performance. Apart from this however, such long-distance links can be planned to work well with predictable performance. During our measurements, we have observed a few hardware/driver quirks as well as system bottlenecks apart from the wireless link itself. We believe that our measurements and the documentation of our experience will help future network planning as well as protocol design for these networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Characterizing mobility or contact patterns in a campus environment is of interest for a variety of reasons. Existing studies of these patterns can be classified into two basic approaches - model based and measurement based. The model based approach involves constructing a mathematical model to generate movement patterns while the measurement based approach measures locations and proximity of wireless devices to infer mobility patterns. In this paper, we take a completely different approach. First we obtain the class schedules and class rosters from a university-wide Intranet learning portal, and use this information to infer contacts made between students. The value of our approach is in the population size involved in the study, where contact patterns among 22341 students are analyzed. This paper presents the characteristics of these contact patterns, and explores how these patterns affect three scenarios. We first look at the characteristics from the DTN perspective, where we study inter-contact time and time distance between pairs of students. Next, we present how these characteristics impact the spread of mobile computer viruses, and show that viruses can spread to virtually the entire student population within a day. Finally, we consider aggregation of information from a large number of mobile, distributed sources, and demonstrate that the contact patterns can be exploited to design efficient aggregation algorithms, in which only a small number of nodes (less than 0.5%) is needed to aggregate a large fraction (over 90%) of the data.</div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Mobile sensors cover more area over a period of time than the same number of stationary sensors. However, the quality of coverage achieved by mobile sensors depends on the velocity, mobility pattern, number of mobile sensors deployed and the dynamics of the phenomenon being sensed. The gains attained by mobile sensors over static sensors and the optimal motion strategies for mobile sensors are not well understood. In this paper we consider the problem of event capture using mobile sensors. The events of interest arrive at certain points in the sensor field and fade away according to arrival and departure time distributions. An event is said to be captured if it is sensed by one of the mobile sensors before it fades away. For this scenario we analyze how the quality of coverage scales with the velocity, path and number of mobile sensors. We characterize the cases where the deployment of mobile sensors has no advantage over static sensors and find the optimal velocity pattern that a mobile sensor should adopt.We also present algorithms for two motion planning problems: (i) for a single sensor, what is the <i>minimum speed</i> and sensor trajectory required to satisfy a bound on event loss probability and (ii) for sensors with fixed speed, what is the <i>minimum number of sensors</i> required to satisfy a bound on event loss probability. When events occur only along a line or a closed curve our algorithms return optimal velocity for the minimum velocity problem. For the minimum sensor problem, the number of sensors used is within a factor two of the optimal solution. For the case where the events occur at arbitrary points on a plane we present heuristic algorithms for the above motion planning problems and bound their performance with respect to the optimal. The results of this paper have wide range of applications in areas like surveillance, wildlife monitoring, hybrid sensor networks and under-water sensor networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

The global topology of the network is of great importance to both sensor network applications and the implementation of networking functionalities. In this paper we study the problem of topology discovery, in particular, identifying boundaries in a sensor network. Suppose a large number of sensor nodes are scattered in a geometric region, with nearby nodes communicating with each other directly. Our goal is to find the boundary nodes by using only connectivity information. We do not assume any knowledge of the node locations or inter-distances, nor do we enforce that the communication graph follows the unit disk graph model. We propose a simple, distributed algorithm that correctly detects nodes on the boundaries and connects them into meaningful boundary cycles. We obtain as a byproduct the medial axis of the sensor field, which has applications in creating virtual coordinates for routing. We show by extensive simulation that the algorithm gives good results even for networks with low density. We also prove rigorously the correctness of the algorithm for continuous geometric domains.</div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Researchers have proposed many wireless MAC protocols such as [20], [8], [25], [24], [6], and [17] which exploit frequency-agile radios and multiple available channels to increase network through-put. These protocols usually only require each node to have one radio. By carefully coordinating the frequency hopping of different nodes, different node pairs can use multiple channels simultaneously. In [17], Mo et al classified these protocols into four generalized categories and compared their performances through both analysis and simulation. They found that the Parallel Rendezvous family of protocols has the best overall performance by removing the bottleneck of a single control channel. These protocols show good promise for use with multi-hop networks because these networks suffer from self-interference and traditional MAC protocols using only one channel often fail to provide satisfactory throughput. However, we are not aware of any implemented Parallel Rendezvous multi-channel MAC protocols. We argue one major reason is that existing proposals such as McMAC[17] and SSCH[6] have not thoroughly considered a practical aspect of the design essential for a working implementation, namely: synchronization. Through an exploration including an implementation exercise on hardware, we show that synchronization for multi-channel MAC protocols is a non-trivial problem. We designed and implemented a synchronization mechanism specifically for this purpose and show that it has tackled the problem of synchronizing one-hop neighbor pairs effectively, thereby paving the way for efficient multi-channel MAC protocols.</div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we critique five design guidelines adopted by most existing algorithms. Our study reveals that these seemingly correct guidelines can be misleading in practice, thus incur significant performance penalty in certain scenarios. The fundamental challenge is that rate adaptation must accurately estimate the channel condition despite the presence of various dynamics caused by fading, mobility and hidden terminals. Second, we design and implement a new Robust Rate Adaptation Algorithm (RRAA)that addresses the above challenge. RRAA uses short-term loss ratio to opportunistically guide its rate change decisions, and an adaptive RTS filter to prevent collision losses from triggering rate decrease. Our extensive experiments have shown that RRAA outperforms three well-known rate adaptation solutions (ARF, AARF, and SampleRate) in all tested scenarios, with throughput improvement up to 143%.</div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Flash crowds and high concentrations of users in wireless LANs (WLANs) cause significant interference problems and unsustainable load at access points. This leads to poor connectivity for users, severe performance degradation, and possible WLAN collapse. To validate this claim, we present two case studies of large, heavily loaded operational WLANs. These studies provide significant insight into the degraded performance and collapse of a WLAN during heavy use. To address these problems, we propose IQU, a practical queue-based user association management system for heavily loaded WLANs. IQU grants users fair opportunities to access the WLAN while maintaining high overall throughput, even when the WLAN is heavily loaded. The basic premise of IQU is to control user associations with the WLAN through request queues and work period allocations. We implement a prototype of IQU and evaluate it on a wireless testbed. Our evaluation demonstrates that IQU significantly improves network throughput under heavy load; the tradeoff is that users have to wait for network access. We explore the impact of IQU parameters on system performance, and validate the robustness of IQU under heavy load conditions. Through IQU, WLANs can be utilized efficiently and network collapse prevented.</div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Wireless 802.11 hotspots have grown in an uncoordinated fashion with highly variable deployment densities. Such uncoordinated deployments, coupled with the difficulty of implementing coordination protocols, has often led to conflicting configurations (e.g., in choice of transmission power and channel of operation) among the corresponding Access Points (APs). Overall, such conflicts cause both unpredictable network performance and unfairness among clients of neighboring hotspots. In this paper, we focus on the fairness problem for uncoordinated deployments. We study this problem from the channel assignment perspective. Our solution is based on the notion of channel-hopping, and meets all the important design considerations for control methods in uncoordinated deployments - distributed in nature, minimal to zero coordination among APs belonging to different hotspots, simple to implement, and interoperable with existing standards. In particular, we propose a specific algorithm called MAXchop, which works efficiently when using only non-overlapping wireless channels, but is particularly effective in exploiting partially-overlapped channels that have been proposed in recent literature. We also evaluate how our channel assignment approach complements previously proposed carrier sensing techniques in providing further performance improvements. Through extensive simulations on real hotspot topologies and evaluation of a full implementation of this technique, we demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques for not only fairness, but also the aggregate throughput, metrics.We believe that this is the first work that brings into focus the fairness properties of channel hopping techniques and we hope that the insights from this research will be applied to other domains where a fair division of a system's resources is an important consideration.</div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide22" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The transformation of telecommunications networks from homogeneous closed systems providing only voice services to Internet-connected open networks that provide voice and data services presents significant security challenges. For example, recent research illustrated that a carefully crafted DoS attack via text messaging could incapacitate all voice communications in a metropolitan area with little more than a cable modem. This attack highlights a growing threat to these systems; namely, cellular networks are increasingly exposed to adversaries both in and outside the network. In this paper, we use a combination of modeling and simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of targeted text messaging attacks. Under realistic network conditions, we show that adversaries can achieve blocking rates of more than 70% with only limited resources. We then develop and characterize five techniques from within two broad classes of countermeasures - queue management and resource provisioning. Our analysis demonstrates that these techniques can eliminate or extensively mitigate even the most intense targeted text messaging attacks. We conclude by considering the tradeoffs inherent to the application of these techniques in current and next generation telecommunications networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll22" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll22',22)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper, it is shown that the coexistence of a variety of different traffics in third generation cellular networks may lead to a very undesirable behavior of the whole network: <i>a metastability property</i>. When this property holds, the state of the network fluctuates on a <i>very long time scale</i> between different set of states. These long oscillations of the network make impossible to predict the average performances of some of the key characteristics of the connections, such as the handoff blocking rate or the probability of call blocking. As a consequence, the quality of service provided by such a network can be guaranteed only by, sometimes poor, lower bounds. Experiments of a UMTS network with this behavior are presented and the analysis of a corresponding simplified mathematical model is developed.

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">TCP is the dominant transport protocol over both wired and wireless links. It is however, well known that TCP is not suitable for wireless networks and several solutions have been proposed to rectify this shortcoming. In this work, we explore cross-layer optimization of the rate <i>adaptation</i> feature of cellular networks to optimize throughput of a single long-lived TCP session. Modern cellular networks rate RF technology that allows them to dynamically vary the wireless channel rate in response to user demand and channel conditions. However, the set of data rates as well as the scheduler's rate adaptation policy are typically chosen to optimize throughput for <i>inelastic</i> applications. In order to optimize such a system for TCP, we propose a <i>two state</i> TCP-aware scheduler that switches between two chanrates as a function of the TCP sending rate. We develop a fluid model of the steady-state behavior of a TCP session in such a system and derive analytical expressions for TCP throughput that explicitly account for rate variability as well as the dependency between the scheduler and TCP. Using the model we choose RF layer parameters that, in conjunction with the TCP-aware scheduler, improve term throughput of a single TCP flow by 15.25%. We also compare our analytical results against those obtained from <i>ns-2</i> simulations and confirm that our model indeed closely approximates TCP behavior in such an environment.</div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We consider the problem of throughput-optimal scheduling in wireless networks subject to interference constraints. We model the interference using a family of K -hop interference models. We define a K-hop interference model as one for which no two links within K hops can successfully transmit at the same time (Note that IEEE 802.11 DCF corresponds to a 2-hop interference model.) .For a given K, a throughput-optimal scheduler needs to solve a maximum weighted matching problem subject to the K-hop interference constraints. For K=1, the resulting problem is the classical Maximum Weighted Matching problem, that can be solved in polynomial time. However, we show that for K&gt;1,the resulting problems are NP-Hard and cannot be approximated within a factor that grows polynomially with the number of nodes. Interestingly, we show that for specific kinds of graphs, that can be used to model the underlying connectivity graph of a wide range of wireless networks, the resulting problems admit polynomial time approximation schemes. We also show that a simple greedy matching algorithm provides a constant factor approximation to the scheduling problem for all K in this case. We then show that under a setting with single-hop traffic and no rate control, the maximal scheduling policy considered in recent related works can achieve a constant fraction of the capacity region for networks whose connectivity graph can be represented using one of the above classes of graphs. These results are encouraging as they suggest that one can develop distributed algorithms to achieve near optimal throughput in case of a wide range of wireless networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

We employ the Protocol Model for successful packet reception usually adopted in network capacity studies and provide novel upper and lower bounds for the broadcast capacity for arbitrary connected networks. In a homogeneous dense network these bounds simplify to Θ(W/max(1,Δ<sup>d</sup>)) where <i>W</i> is the wireless channel capacity, Δ the interference parameter, and <i>d</i> the number of dimensions of space in which the network lies. Interestingly, we show that the broadcast capacity does not change by more than a constant factor when we vary the number of nodes, the radio range, the area of the network, and even the node mobility. To address the achievability of capacity, we demonstrate that any broadcast scheme based on a backbone of size proportional to the Minimum Connected Dominating Set guarantees a throughput within a constant factor of the broadcast capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that broadcast capacity, in stark contrast to unicast capacity, does not depend on the choice of source nodes or the dimension of the network.</div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

Principal focus is placed on the evaluation of multi-user diversity, multi-access diversity and trunking gains. Scenarios with persistent and non-persistent data flows are investigated, concentrating on throughput and transfer time performance, respectively. A number of numerical experiments are included in order to quantify the relative contribution of the distinguished aspects to the performance gain. These experiments indicate that the exploitation of multi-user diversity with a channel-aware access selection scheme attains the most significant gains, while also the trunking gain that is due to an above-proportional performance enhancement when aggregating system-specific capacities, is noted to be significant.

<span id="toHide30" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We study efficient <i>link scheduling</i> for a multihop wireless network to maximize its throughput. Efficient link scheduling can greatly reduce the interference effect of close-by transmissions. Unlike the previous studies that often assume a unit disk graph model, we assume that different terminals could have different transmission ranges and different interference ranges. In our model, it is also possible that a <i>communication link</i> may <i>not</i> exist due to barriers or is not used by a predetermined routing protocol, while the transmission of a node always result interference to <i>all</i> non-intended receivers within its interference range. Using a mathematical formulation, we develop synchronized TDMA link schedulings that optimize the networking throughput. Specifically, by assuming known link capacities and link traffic loads, we study link scheduling under the RTS/CTS interference model and the protocol interference model with fixed transmission power. For both models, we present both efficient centralized and distributed algorithms that use time slots within a constant factor of the optimum. We also present efficient distributed algorithms whose performances are still comparable with optimum, but with much less communications. Our theoretical results are corroborated by extensive simulation studies.</div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide32" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">For data-collection applications in sensor networks, it is important to ensure all data sources have equal (or weighted) access to network bandwidth so that the base stations receive a complete picture about the monitored area. We point out the fairness problem in the current design of sensor networks, which may cause extremely biased bandwidth allocations. It is a challenge to design a fully distributed fairness solution due to the lack of global knowledge about the distribution of data sources and their routing paths. This paper proposes a new <i>aggregate fairnes</i>s model and a localized algorithm (called AFA) that implements the model. AFA is designed to work with any routing protocol. In particular, it allows the packets from a data source to follow an arbitrary set of forwarding paths to the base stations. This flexibility makes it considerably harder to allocate bandwidth fairly among different data sources. AFA solves the problem with only localized operations at the sensors. It is easy to implement, which is an attractive property for sensor networks. Moreover, the algorithm automatically adjusts a sensor's forwarding rate to avoid packet drops due to downstream congestion, which helps improve energy efficiency. We perform extensive simulations, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve end-to-end fairness.</div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

In-network storage such as geographical hash table (GHTs) has been proposed to store data at rendezvous nodes for consumers to retrieve. In this paper, we propose a <i>double rulings</i> scheme which stores data replica at a curve instead of one or multiple isolated sensors. The consumer travels along another curve which guarantees to intersect with the producer curve. The double rulings is a natural extension of the flat hashing scheme such as GHTs with improved query locality, i.e., consumers close to producers find the data quickly, and structured aggregate queries, i.e., a consumer following a curve is able to retrieve <i>all</i> the data. Further, by the flexibility of retrieval mechanisms we have better routing robustness and data robustness.

Underwater sensor networks will find applications in oceano-graphic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, assisted navigation, tactical surveillance, and mine reconnaissance. Underwater acoustic networking is the enabling technology for these applications. In this paper, an architecture for three-dimensional underwater sensor networks is considered, and a model characterizing the acoustic channel utilization efficiency is introduced, which allows investigating some fundamental characteristics of the underwater environment. In particular, the model allows setting the optimal packet size for underwater communications given monitored volume, density of the sensor network, and application requirements. Moreover, the problem of data gathering is investigated at the network layer by considering the cross-layer interactions between the routing functions and the characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel. Two distributed routing algorithms are introduced for delay-insensitive and delay-sensitive applications. The proposed solutions allow each node to select its next hop, with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption taking the varying condition of the underwater channel and the different application requirements into account. The proposed routing solutions are shown to achieve the performance targets by means of simulation.</div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide35" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In many energy-constrained wireless sensor networks, nodes cooperatively forward correlated sensed data to data sinks. In order to reduce the communication cost (e.g.overall energy) used for data collection, previous works have focused on specific coding schemes, such as Slepian-Wolf Code or Explicit Entropy Code. However, the minimum communication cost under arbitrary coding/routing schemes has not yet been characterized. In this paper, we consider the problem of minimizing the total communication cost of a wireless sensor network with a single sink. We prove that the minimum communication cost can be achieved using Slepian-Wolf Code and Commodity Flow Routing when the link communication cost is a convex function of link data rate. Furthermore, we find it useful to introduce a new metric distance entropy, a generalization of entropy, to characterize the data collection limit of networked sources. When the energy consumption is proportional to the link data rate (e.g.normally in 802.11), we show that distance entropy provides a lower bound of the communication cost and can be achieved by using a specific rate SWC and shortest path routing. Theoretically, achieving optimality may require global knowledge of the data correlation structure, which may not be available in practice. Therefore, we propose a simple, hierarchical scheme that primarily exploits data correlation between local neighboring nodes. We show that for several correlation structures and topologies, the communication cost achieved by this scheme is within a constant factor of the distance entropy, i.e., it is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we simulate our algorithm using radar reffectivity data as well as traces from Gaussian Markov Fields (GMF). As the network size goes large, for the radar data, we find our algorithm saves two thirds of the communication cost compared to a non-coding approach; as for the GMF data, our algorithm converges to a constant factor (1 .5_1.8) the distance entropy.</div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">RFID tags are being used in many diverse applications in increasingly large numbers. These capabilities of these tags span from very dumb passive tags to smart active tags, with the cost of these tags correspondingly ranging from a few pennies to many dollars. One of the common problems that arise in any RFID deployment is the problem of quick estimation of the number of tags in the field up to a desired level of accuracy. Prior work in this area has focused on the identification of tags, which needs more time, and is unsuitable for many situations, especially where the tag set is dense. We take a different, more practical approach, and provide very fast and reliable estimation mechanisms. In particular, we analyze our estimation schemes and show that the time needed to estimate the number of tags in the system for a given accuracy is much better than schemes presented in related work. We show that one can estimate the cardinality of tag-sets of any size in near-constant time, for a given accuracy of estimation.</div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

Fundamental to a kiosk's operation is its connection to the Internet. Network connectivity today is primarily provided by dialup telephone, although Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) or long-distance wireless links are also being deployed. These solutions tend to be both expensive and failure prone. Instead, we propose the use of buses and cars as "mechanical backhaul" devices to carry data to and from a village and an internet gateway. Building on the pioneering lead of Daknet [15], and extending the Delay Tolerant Networking Research Group architecture [24], we describe a comprehensive solution, encompassing naming, addressing, forwarding, routing, identity management, application support, and security. We believe that this architecture not only meets the top-level goals of low cost and robustness, but also exposes fundamental architectural principles necessary for any such design.

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Although most wireless terrestrial networks are based on two-dimensional (2D) design, in reality, such networks operate in three-dimensions (3D). Since most often the size (i.e., the length and the width) of such terrestrial networks is significantly larger than the differences in the third dimension (i.e., the height) of the nodes, the 2D assumption is somewhat justified and usually it does not lead to major inaccuracies. However, in some environments, this is not the case; the underwater, atmospheric, or space communications being such apparent examples. In fact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints at the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the design of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D networks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture required centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D counterparts are trivial to solve. In this paper, we consider the coverage and connectivity issues of 3D networks, where the goal is to find a node placement strategy with 100% sensing coverage of a 3D space, while minimizing the number of nodes required for surveillance. Our results indicate that the use of the Voronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results in the best strategy. In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the transmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to maintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142 and 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy or a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the required number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron placement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number of nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy. We verify by simulation that our placement strategies indeed guarantee ubiquitous coverage. We believe that our approach and our results presented in this paper could be used for extending the processes of 2D network design to 3D networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide40" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">A main distinguishing feature of a wireless network compared with a wired network is its broadcast nature, in which the signal transmitted by a node may reach several other nodes, and a node may receive signals from several other nodes simultaneously. Rather than a blessing, this feature is treated more as an interference-inducing nuisance in most wireless networks today (e.g., IEEE 802.11). The goal of this paper is to show how the concept of network coding can be applied at the physical layer to turn the broadcast property into a capacity-boosting advantage in wireless ad hoc networks. Specifically, we propose a physical-layer network coding (PNC) scheme to coordinate transmissions among nodes. In contrast to "straightforward" network coding which performs coding arithmetic on digital bit streams after they have been received, PNC makes use of the additive nature of simultaneously arriving electromagnetic (EM) waves for equivalent coding operation. PNC can yield higher capacity than straight-forward network coding when applied to wireless networks. We believe this is a first paper that ventures into EM-wave-based network coding at the physical layer and demonstrates its potential for boosting network capacity. PNC opens up a whole new research area because of its implications and new design requirements for the physical, MAC, and network layers of ad hoc wireless stations. The resolution of the many outstanding but interesting issues in PNC may lead to a revolutionary new paradigm for wireless ad hoc networking.</div></span> <a id="expcoll40" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll40',40)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide42" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The importance of spatial reuse in wireless ad-hoc networks has been long recognized as a key to improving the network capacity. One can increase the level of spatial reuse by either reducing the transmit power or increasing the carrier sense threshold (thereby reducing the carrier sense range). On the other hand, as the transmit power decreases or the carrier sense threshold increases, the SINR decreases as a result of the smaller received signal or the increased interference level. Consequently, the data rate sustained by each transmission may decrease. This leads naturally to the following questions:(1)How can the trade-off between the increased level of spatial reuse and the decreased data rate each node can sustain be quantified? In other words,is there an optimal range of transmit power/carrier sense threshold in which the network capacity is maximized? (2)What is the relation between the transmit power and the carrier sense threshold.In this paper, we study both problems, and show that (i)in the case that the achievable channel rate follows the Shannon capacity, spatial reuse depends only on the ratio of the transmit power to the carrier sense threshold; and (ii) in the case that only a set of discrete data rates are available, tuning the transmit power offers several advantages that tuning the carrier sense threshold cannot, provided that there is a sufficient number of power levels available. Based on the findings, we then propose a decentralized power and rate control algorithm to enable each node to adjust, based on its signal interference level, its transmit power and data rate. The transmit power is so determined that the transmitter can sustain a high data rate, while keeping the adverse interference effect on the other neighboring concurrent transmissions minimal. Simulation results have shown that, as compared to existing carrier sense threshold tuning algorithms, the proposed power and rate control algorithm yields higher network capacity.</div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

Specifically, we investigate the <i>granularity of channel assignment decisions</i> that gives the best trade-off in terms of performance and complexity. We present a new granularity for channel assignment that we refer to as <i>component level channel assignment</i>. The strategy is relatively simple, and is characterized by several impressive practical advantages. We also show that the theoretical performance of the component based channel assignment strategy does not lag significantly behind the optimal possible performance, and perhaps more importantly we show that when coupled with its several practical advantages, it significantly outperforms other strategies under most network conditions.</div></span> <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll43',43)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide44" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">It was recently reported that all known face and combined greedy-face routing variants cannot guarantee message delivery in arbitrary undirected planar graphs. The purpose of this article is to clarify that this is not the truth in general. We show that specifically in relative neighborhood and Gabriel graphs recovery from a greedy routing failure is always possible without changing between any adjacent faces. Guaranteed delivery then follows from guaranteed recovery while traversing the very first face. In arbitrary graphs, however, a proper face selection mechanism is of importance since recovery from a greedy routing failure may require visiting a sequence of faces before greedy routing can be restarted again. A prominent approach is to visit a sequence of faces which are intersected by the line connecting the source and destination node. Whenever encountering an edge which is intersecting with this line, the critical part is to decide if face traversal has to change to the next adjacent one or not. Failures may occur from incorporating face routing procedures that force to change the traversed face at each intersection. Recently observed routing failures which were produced by the GPSR protocol in arbitrary planar graphs result from incorporating such a face routing variant. They cannot be constructed by the well known GFG algorithm which does not force changing the face anytime. Beside methods which visit the faces intersected by the source destination line, we discuss face routing variants which simply restart face routing whenever the next face has to be explored. We give the first complete and formal proofs that several proposed face routing, and combined greedyface routing schemes do guarantee delivery in specific graph classes or even any arbitrary planar graphs. We also discuss the reasons why other methods may fail to deliver a message or even end up in a loop.</div></span> <a id="expcoll44" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll44',44)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide45" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We propose novel solutions for unicast routing in wireless networks consisted of selfish terminals: in order to alleviate the inevitable over-payment problem (and thus economic inefficiency) of the VCG (Vickrey-Clark-Groves) mechanism, we design a mechanism that results in Nash equilibria rather than the traditional strate-gyproofness (using weakly dominant strategy). In addition, we systematically study the <i>unicast routing system</i> in which both the relay terminals and the service requestor (either the source or the destination nodes or both) could be selfish. To the best of our knowledge, this is the <i>first</i> paper that presents <i>social efficient</i> unicast routing systems with proved performance guarantee. Thus, we call the proposed systems: Optimal Unicast Routing Systems (OURS).Our main contributions of OURS are as follows. (1) For the principal model where the service requestor is not selfish, we propose a mechanism that provably creates incentives for intermediate terminals to cooperate in forwarding packets for others. Our mechanism substantially reduces the overpayment by using Nash equilibrium solutions as opposed to strategyproof solutions. We then study a more realistic case where the service requestor can act selfishly. (2) We first show that if we insist on the requirement of strategyproofness for the relay terminals, then no system can guarantee that the central authority can retrieve at least 1over<i>n</i> of the total payment. (3) We then present a strategyproof unicast system that collects 1over2<i>n</i> of the total payment, which is thus asymptotically optimum. (4) By only requiring Nash Equilibrium solutions, we propose a system that creates incentives for the service requestor and intermediate terminals to correctly follow the prescribed protocol. More importantly, the central authority can retrieve at least half the total payment. We verify the economic efficiency of our systems through simulations that are based on very realistic terminal distributions.</div></span> <a id="expcoll45" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll45',45)">expand</a>
