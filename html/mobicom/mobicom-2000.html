<span id="toHide1" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>To understand better how users take advantage of wireless networks, we examine a twelve-week trace of a building-wide local-area wireless network. We analyze the network for overall user behavior (when and how intensively people use the network and how much they move around), overall network traffic and load characteristics (observed throughput and symmetry of incoming and outgoing traffic), and traffic characteristics from a user point of view (observed mix of applications and number of hosts connected to by users).</par>
<par>Amongst other results, we find that users are divided into distinct location-based sub-communities, each with its own movement, activity, and usage characteristics. Most users exploit the network for web-surfing, session-oriented activities and chat-oriented activities. The high number of chat-oriented activities shows that many users take advantage of the mobile network for synchronous communication with others. In addition to these user-specific results, we find that peak throughput is usually caused by a single user and application. Also, while incoming traffic dominates outgoing traffic overall, the opposite tends to be true during periods of peak throughput, implying that significant asymmetry in network capacity could be undesirable for our users.</par>
<par>While these results are only valid for this local-area wireless network and user community, we believe that similar environments may exhibit similar behavior and trends. We hope that our observations will contribute to a growing understanding of mobile user behavior.</par>

Dynamic power management (DPM) policies trade off the performance for the power consumption at the system level in portable devices. In this work we present the time-indexed SMDP model (TISMDP) that we use to derive optimal policy for DPM in portable systems. TISMDP model is needed to handle the non-exponential user request interarrival times we observed in practice. We use our policy to control power consumption on three different devices: the SmartBadge portable device [18], the Sony Vaio laptop hard disk and WLAN card. Simulation results show large savings for all three devices when using our algorithm. In addition, we measured the power consumption and performance of our algorithm and compared it with other DPM algorithms for laptop hard disk and WLAN card. The algorithm based on our TISMDP model has 1.7 times less power consumption as compared to the default Windows timeout policy for the hard disk and three times less power consumption as compared to the default algorithm for the WLAN card.</par>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>The GUIDE system has been developed to provide city visitors with a hand-held context-aware tourist guide. The system has been successfully deployed in a major tourist destination and is currently at the stage where it is publicly available to visitors who wish to explore the city. Reaching this stage has been the culmination of a number of distinct research efforts. In more detail, the development of GUIDE has involved: capturing a real set of application requirements, investigating the properties of a cell-based wireless communications technology in a built-up environment and deploying a network based on this technology around the city, designing and populating an information model to represent attractions and key buildings within the city, prototyping the development of a distributed application running across portable GUIDE units and stationary cell-servers and finally, evaluating the entire system during an extensive field-trial study. This paper reports on our results in each of these areas. We believe that through our work on the GUIDE project we have produced a blueprint for the development of interactive context-aware systems that should be of real value to those in the community who wish to develop such systems in a practical environment.</par>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of <italic>Cricket</italic>, a location-support system for in-building, mobile, location-dependent applications. It allows applications running on mobile and static nodes to learn their physical location by using <italic>listeners</italic> that hear and analyze information from <italic>beacons</italic> spread throughout the building. Cricket is the result of several design goals, including user privacy, decentralized administration, network heterogeneity, and low cost. Rather than explicitly tracking user location, Cricket helps devices learn where they are and lets them decide whom to advertise this information to; it does not rely on any centralized management or control and there is no explicit coordination between beacons; it provides information to devices regardless of their type of network connectivity; and each Cricket device is made from off-the-shelf components and costs less than U.S. $10. We describe the randomized algorithm used by beacons to transmit information, the use of concurrent radio and ultrasonic signals to infer distance, the listener inference algorithms to overcome multipath and interference, and practical beacon configuration and positioning techniques that improve accuracy. Our experience with Cricket shows that several location-dependent applications such as in-building active maps and device control can be developed with little effort or manual configuration.</par>

Previous research in this area has concentrated on routing algorithms which are designed for fully connected networks. The usual way to deal with a disconnected ad-hoc network is to let the mobile computer wait for network reconnection passively, which may lead to unacceptable transmission delays. In this paper, we propose an approach that guarantees message transmission in minimal time. In this approach, mobile hosts actively modify their trajectories to transmit messages. We develop algorithms that minimize the trajectory modifications under two different assumptions: (a) the movements of all the nodes in the system are known and (b) the movements of the hosts in the system are not known.</par>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>This paper analyzes two analytical mobility models for their suitability to handover modeling and to the estimation of signaling cost. Some insufficiencies of the often employed Hong/Rappaport model are detected. Here, an infinite mean dwell time occurs which is not suitable for performance evaluation of mobile communications systems. Therefore, handover modeling is not possible. To prevent infinite dwell times, an universal condition for the velocity distribution is derived. The biased sampling formula of the velocity distribution fulfills our universal condition. Finally, the consequences of the biased sampling of the velocity for the signaling traffic are discussed for the modified Hong/Rappaport model and a highway model. In contrast to the analytical calculations without consideration of biased sampling, we detect a significant increase of signaling traffic. It is shown that the probability density function of the velocity of the boundary-crossing subscribers is given by the biased sampling formula. Thus, for handover modeling and the exact estimation of signaling traffic the biased sampling formula of the velocity has to be taken into account in analytical calculations in any case.</par>

However, these two criteria can potentially be in conflict in a generic-topology multihop wireless network where a single logical channel is shared among multiple contending flows and spatial reuse of the channel bandwidth is possible. In this paper, we propose a new model for packet scheduling that addresses this conflict. The main results of this paper are the following: (a) a two-tier service model that provides a minimum “fair” allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally maximizes spatial reuse of bandwidth, (b) an ideal centralized packet scheduling algorithm that realizes the above service model, and (c) a practical distributed backoff-based channel contention mechanism that approximates the ideal service within the framework of the CSMA/CA protocol.</par>

<par>In this paper, we propose a <italic>general analytical framework that captures the unique characteristics of shared wireless channels</italic> and allows the modeling of a large class of system-wide fairness models via the specification of per-flow utility functions. We show that system-wide fairness can be achieved without explicit global coordination so long as each node executes a contention resolution algorithm that is designed to optimize its local utility function.</par>
<par>We present a <italic>general mechanism for translating a given fairness model in our framework into a corresponding contention resolution algorithm</italic>. Using this translation, we derive the backoff algorithm for achieving <italic>proportional fairness</italic> in wireless shared channels, and compare the fairness properties of this algorithm with both the ideal proportional fairness objective, and state-of-the-art backoff-based contention resolution algorithms.</par>
<par>We believe that the two aspects of the proposed framework, i.e. the ability to specify arbitrary fairness models via local utility functions, and the ability to automatically generate local contention resolution mechanisms in response to a given utility function, together provide the path for achieving flexible service differentiation in future shared channel wireless networks.</par>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>Global wireless networks enable mobile users to communicate regardless of their locations. One of the most important issues is location management in a highly dynamic environment because mobile users may roam between different wireless networks, network operators, and geographical regions. In this paper, a location tracking mechanism is introduced, which consists of intersystem location updates using the concept of boundary location area (BLA) and paging using the concept of boundary location register (BLR). The BLA is determined by a dynamic location update policy in which the velocity and the quality of service (QoS) are taken into account on a per-user basis. The BLR is used to maintain the records of mobile users crossing the boundary of networks. This mechanism not only reduces location tracking costs but also significantly decreases call loss rates and average paging delays. The performance evaluation of the proposed schemes is provided to demonstrate their effectiveness in multitier wireless networks.</par>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>A method of reducing the wireless cost of tracking mobile users with uncertain parameters is developed in this paper. Such uncertainty arises naturally in wireless networks, since an efficient user tracking is based on a <italic>prediction</italic> of its future call and mobility parameters. The conventional approach based on dynamic tracking is not reliable in the sense that inaccurate prediction of the user mobility parameters may significantly reduce the tracking efficiency. Unfortunately, such uncertainty is unavoidable for mobile users, especially for bursty mobility pattern.</par>
<par>In this study we propose a novel approach, which is efficient yet reliable. The basic idea is to incorporate a distributed scheme with a centralized scheme. The location update process incorporates a topology-independent distance based strategy and a load-sensitive timer. This combination forms a mechanism that bounds from above the <italic>total</italic> tracking cost. The registration activity is governed by the system, such that it increases at lowly loaded cells and decreases at heavily loaded cells.</par>
<par>The expected wireless cost of tracking under the proposed method is significantly reduced, in comparison to the existing methods currently used in cellular networks. Furthermore, as opposed to other tracking methods, the worst case tracking cost is bounded from above and governed by the system. The proposed strategy can be easily implemented, and it does not require a significant computational power from the user.</par>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>GLS is a new distributed location service which tracks mobile node locations. GLS combined with geographic forwarding allows the construction of ad hoc mobile networks that scale to a larger number of nodes than possible with previous work. GLS is decentralized and runs on the mobile nodes themselves, requiring no fixed infrastructure. Each mobile node periodically updates a small set of other nodes (its location servers) with its current location. A node sends its position updates to its location servers without knowing their actual identities, assisted by a predefined ordering of node identifiers and a predefined geographic hierarchy. Queries for a mobile node's location also use the predefined identifier ordering and spatial hierarchy to find a location server for that node.</par>
<par>Experiments using the <italic>ns</italic> simulator for up to 600 mobile nodes show that the storage and bandwidth requirements of GLS grow slowly with the size of the network. Furthermore, GLS tolerates node failures well: each failure has only a limited effect and query performance degrades gracefully as nodes fail and restart. The query performance of GLS is also relatively insensitive to node speeds. Simple geographic forwarding combined with GLS compares favorably with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR): in larger networks (over 200 nodes) our approach delivers more packets, but consumes fewer network resources.</par>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>Compressing protocol headers has traditionally been an attractive way of conserving bandwidth over low-speed links, including those in wireless systems. However, despite the growth in recent years in the number of end-to-end protocols beyond TCP/IP, header compression deployment for those protocols has not kept pace. This is in large part due to complexities in implementation, which often requires a detailed knowledge of kernel internals, and a lack of a common way of pursuing the general problem across a variety of end-to-end protocols. To address this, rather than defining several new protocol-specific standards, we present a unified framework for header compression. This framework includes a simple, platform-independent header description language that protocol implementors can use to describe high-level header properties, and a platform-specific code generation tool that produces kernel source code automatically from this header specification. Together, the high-level description language and code generator free protocol designers from having to understand any details of the target platform, enabling them to implement header compression with relatively little effort. We analyze the performance of compression produced using this framework for TCP/IP in the Linux 2.0 kernel and demonstrate that unified, automatically-generated header compression without significant performance penalty is viable.</par>

Existing TCP connections are retained using secure and efficient connection migration, enabling established connections to seamlessly negotiate a change in endpoint IP addresses without the need for a third party. Our architecture is secure—name updates are effected via the secure DNS update protocol, while TCP connection migration uses a novel set of <italic>Migrate</italic> options—and provides a pure end-system alternative to routing-based approaches such as Mobile IP.</par>
<par>Mobile IP was designed under the principle that fixed Internet hosts and applications were to remain unmodified and only the underlying IP substrate should change. Our architecture requires no changes to the unicast IP substrate, instead modifying transport protocols and applications at the end hosts. We argue that this is not a hindrance to deployment; rather, in a significant number of cases, it allows for an easier deployment path than Mobile IP, while simultaneously giving better performance. We compare and contrast the strengths of end-to-end and network-layer mobility schemes, and argue that end-to-end schemes are better suited to many common mobile applications. Our performance experiments show that hand-off times are governed by TCP migrate latencies, and are on the order of a round-trip time of the communicating peers.</par>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>In a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) network, multiple mobile hosts (MHs) can simultaneously transmit over the wireless channel by using different codes. To assure an acceptable quality of service for all users' flows, the network usually tunes the transmit powers of all MHs to achieve a certain level of signal strength as compared to the noise and the interference (SINR) for each user. The traditional assumption in power control schemes is that the SINR requirement is statically determined for each user flow.</par>
<par>In contrast, in this paper, we propose a scheme that dynamically adapts the SINR requirements of user flows based on its quality of service (QoS) requirements and the conditions of the wireless channel between the MHs and the base station. As a result of this adaptation, we show that network-level QoS measures such as fraction of packets meeting their delay requirements and energy consumed per packet transmission are significantly better than in a scheme that statically fixes the SINR requirements.</par>
<par>Our scheme uses a simple table-driven approach for optimally selecting the target SINR requirement for each MH at run time. The entries in the table are computed offline using a dynamic programming algorithm with the objective of maximizing a profit function that balances the need for meeting the network-level QoS requirements and the cost of using a particular target SINR for a given transmission.</par>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>Caching frequently accessed data items on the client side is an effective technique to improve performance in a mobile environment. Classical cache invalidation strategies are not suitable for mobile environments due to the disconnection and mobility of the mobile clients. One attractive cache invalidation technique is based on invalidation reports (IRs). However, the IR-based cache invalidation solution has two major drawbacks, which have not been addressed is previous research. First, there is a long query latency associated with this solution since a client cannot answer the query until the next IR interval. Second, when the server updates a hot data item, all clients have to query the server and get the data from the server separately, which wastes a large amount of bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an IR-based cache invalidation algorithm which can significantly reduce the query latency and efficiently utilize the broadcast bandwidth. Detailed simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed methodology. Compared to previous IR-based schemes, our scheme can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the query latency, the number of uplink request, and the broadcast bandwidth requirements.</par>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>Location-dependent applications are becoming very popular in mobile environments. To improve system performance and facilitate disconnection, caching is crucial to such applications. In this paper, a semantic caching scheme is used to access location dependent data in mobile computing. We first develop a mobility model to represent the moving behaviors of mobile users and formally define location dependent queries. We then investigate query processing and cache management strategies. The performance of the semantic caching scheme and its replacement strategy FAR is evaluated through a simulation study. Our results show that semantic caching is more flexible and effective for use in LDD applications than page caching, whose performance is quite sensitive to the database physical organization. We also notice that the semantic cache replacement strategy FAR, which utilizes the semantic locality in terms of locations, performs robustly under different kinds of workloads.</par>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>In a satellite and wireless networks and in advanced traffic information systems in which the up-link bandwidth is very limited, a server broadcasts data files in a round-robin manner. The data files are provided by different providers and are accessed by many clients. The providers are independent and therefore files may share information. The clients who access these files may have different patterns of access. Some clients may wish to access more than one file at a time in any order, some clients may access one file out of of several files, and some clients may wish to access a second file only after accessing another file. The goal of the server is to order the files in a way that minimizes the access time of the clients given some a-priori knowledge of their access patterns. This paper introduces a <italic>clients-providers-servers</italic> model that represents certain environments better than the traditional clients-servers model. Then, we show that a random order of the data files performs well independent of the specific access pattern. Our main technical contribution is showing how to de-randomize the randomized algorithm that is based on selecting a random order. The resulting algorithm is a polynomial time deterministic algorithm that finds an order that achieves the bounds of the random order.</par>

In order to avoid the need for such a route discovery to be performed before each data packet is sent, such routing protocols must cache routes previously discovered. This paper presents an analysis of the effects of different design choices for this caching in on-demand routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks, dividing the problem into choices of cache <italic>structure</italic>, cache <italic>capacity</italic>, and cache <italic>timeout</italic>. Our analysis is based on the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR), which operates entirely on-demand. Using detailed simulations of wireless ad hoc networks of 50 mobile nodes, we studied a large number of different caching algorithms that utilize a range of design choices, and simulated each cache primarily over a set of 50 different movement scenarios drawn from 5 different types of mobility models. We also define a set of new <italic>mobility metrics</italic> that allow accurate characterization of the relative difficulty that a given movement scenario presents to an ad hoc network routing protocol, and we analyze each mobility metric's ability to predict the actual difficulty in terms of routing overhead experienced by the routing protocol across the scenarios in our study.</par>

<span id="toHide23" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><par>We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the <italic>positions</italic> of routers and a packet's destination to make packet forwarding decisions. GPSR makes <italic>greedy</italic> forwarding decisions using only information about a router's immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the <italic>perimeter</italic> of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility's frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR's scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.</par>

The wireless ad-hoc network is particularly vulnerable due to its features of open medium, dynamic changing topology, cooperative algorithms, lack of centralized monitoring and management point, and lack of a clear line of defense. Many of the intrusion detection techniques developed on a fixed wired network are not applicable in this new environment. How to do it differently and effectively is a challenging research problem. In this paper, we first examine the vulnerabilities of a wireless ad-hoc network, the reason why we need intrusion detection, and the reason why the current methods cannot be applied directly.

In this system, we extend the conventional mail format and the server/client(browser) architecture by considering the specific features of wearable computing environments, i.e., full time operation, hands-free use of computer, and close relationship to our daily life. A mail author can specify the behavior of his/her mail by embedding several useful commands in the mail. A user can specify in the mail various conditions as commands such as time, location of the recipient, and status of various sensors to allow an adaptive behavior in the mail. We also describe other features of the system to support user's wearable computing life.</par>

EOFS have strong social relevance in areas such as education, transportation, agriculture, natural resource planning and disaster response. In addition, they represent an opportunity for scientists to study large physical systems to an extent that was not previously possible. Building the next generation of EOFS pose a number of difficult challenges in all aspects of wireless networking, including media protocols for long distance vertical communication through water, flooding algorithms in ad-hoc network topologies, support for rate- and time-sensitive applications, and location-dependent mobile computing.</italic></par>
