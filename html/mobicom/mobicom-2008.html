<span id="toHide1" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We describe new methods for multi-hop mobile wireless network design, so as to meet performance specifications. We introduce an implicitly defined approximate loss model that couples the physical, MAC and routing layers' effects. The model provides quantitative statistical relations between the loss parameters that are used to characterize multiuser interference and physical path conditions on the one hand and the traffic rates and types between origin-destination pairs on the other. The model considers effects of hidden nodes, node scheduling algorithms, MAC and PHY layer failures and unsuccessful packet transmission attempts at the MAC layer in arbitrary network topologies where multiple paths share nodes. We consider both contention-based as well as scheduling-based MAC protocols. The new methods are based on implicit loss network models developed using fixed point methods. We describe the application of Automatic Differentiation (AD) to these implicit performance models, and develop a methodology for sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization for wireless protocols. We also introduce new methods that utilize on-line feedback from the PHY layer to simplify the joint MAC and routing protocol design. We provide several examples, with realistic scenarios, that demonstrate the benefits of applying these new methods in an integrated manner. We close with current and future work that extends these methods and algorithms towards a Component-Based design, performance analysis and validation of distributed protocols for mobile wireless networks. We argue that this set of ideas provides a very promising approach to 'clean slate' design for such networks and the resulting hybrid broadband Internet.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll1" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll1',1)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Market-driven dynamic spectrum auctions can drastically improve the spectrum availability for wireless networks struggling to obtain additional spectrum. However, they face significant challenges due to the fear of market manipulation. A truthful or strategy-proof spectrum auction eliminates the fear by enforcing players to bid their true valuations of the spectrum. Hence bidders can avoid the expensive overhead of strategizing over others and the auctioneer can maximize its revenue by assigning spectrum to bidders who value it the most. Conventional truthful designs, however, either fail or become computationally intractable when applied to spectrum auctions. In this paper, we propose VERITAS, a truthful and computationally-efficient spectrum auction to support an eBay-like dynamic spectrum market. VERITAS makes an important contribution of maintaining truthfulness while maximizing spectrum utilization. We show analytically that VERITAS is truthful, efficient, and has a polynomial complexity of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup><i>k</i>) when n bidders compete for <i>k</i> spectrum bands. Simulation results show that VERITAS outperforms the extensions of conventional truthful designs by up to 200% in spectrum utilization. Finally, VERITAS supports diverse bidding formats and enables the auctioneer to reconfigure allocations for multiple market objectives.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In a cognitive radio network (CRN), in-band spectrum sensing is essential for the protection of legacy spectrum users, with which the presence of primary users (PUs) can be detected promptly, allowing secondary users (SUs) to vacate the channels immediately. For in-band sensing, it is important to meet the detectability requirements, such as the maximum allowed latency of detection (e.g., 2 seconds in IEEE 802.22) and the probability of mis-detection and false-alarm. In this paper, we propose an effcient periodic in-band sensing algorithm that optimizes sensing-frequency and sensing-time by minimizing sensing overhead while meeting the detectability requirements. The proposed scheme determines the better of energy or feature detection that incurs less sensing overhead at each SNR level, and derives the threshold <i>aRSS<sub>threshold</sub></i> on the average received signal strength (RSS) of a primary signal below which feature detection is preferred. We showed that energy detection under lognormal shadowing could still perform well at the average SNR &lt; <i>SNR<sub>wall</sub></i> [1] when collaborative sensing is used for its location diversity. Two key factors affecting detection performance are also considered: noise uncertainty and inter-CRN interference. <i>aRSS<sub>threshold</sub></i> appears to lie between -114.6 dBm and -109.9 dBm with the noise uncertainty ranging from 0.5 dB to 2 dB, and between -112.9 dBm and -110.5 dBm with 1~6 interfering CRNs.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

We explore the opportunity to use sophisticated PHY-layer measurements in wireless networking systems for location distinction. We first compare two existing location distinction methods - one based on channel gains of multi-tonal probes, and another on channel impulse response. Next, we combine the benefits of these two methods to develop a new link measurement that we call the complex temporal signature. We use a 2.4 GHz link measurement data set, obtained from CRAWDAD [10], to evaluate the three location distinction methods. We find that the complex temporal signature method performs significantly better compared to the existing methods. We also perform new measurements to understand and model the temporal behavior of link signatures over time. We integrate our model in our location distinction mechanism and significantly reduce the probability of false alarms due to temporal variations of link signatures.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>A WANET is a wireless network where the wireless nodes can be located anywhere over the globe. However, the underlying design is such that the nodes believe they are part of a single-hop or multi-hop wireless network at the PHY and MAC layers. This is accomplished by using Software Defined Access Points (SoDA) that are based on the idea of Software Defined Radio (SDR). For the uplink, each SoDA samples the down-converted channel using an ADC (analog-to-digital converter). The sampled data is then multicast to the other SoDAs via the Internet. At each end-point, the received digital signals from the other SoDAs are summed and sent through the DAC (digital-to-analog converter) and transmitted on a designated channel after upconversion. In effect what we have done is to mix the RF environment at geographically separate locations (albeit with a time shift). This simple technique leads to a whole new model for designing and using wireless networks. Indeed, we can think of these networks as following the end-to-end model where only the end nodes understand the PHY/MAC layers and the access points and Internet serve simply as dumb relays. This paper describes a series of network models that are enabled and outlines the open research challenges.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>People living in urban areas spend a considerable amount of time on public transport, for example, commuting to/from work. During these periods, opportunities for inter-personal networking present themselves, as many members of the public now carry electronic devices equipped with Bluetooth or other wireless technology. Using these devices, individuals can share content (e.g., music, news and video clips) with fellow travellers that are on the same train or bus. Transferring media content takes time; in order to maximise the chances of successful downloads, users should identify neighbours that possess desirable content and who will travel with them for <i>long-enough</i> periods. In this paper, we propose a user-centric prediction scheme that collects <i>historical</i> colocation information to determine the best content sources. The scheme works on the assumption that people have a high degree of regularity in their movements. We first validate this assumption on a real dataset, that consists of traces of people moving in a large city's mass transit system. We then demonstrate experimentally on these traces that our prediction scheme significantly improves communication efficiency, when compared to a memory(history)-less source selection scheme.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile Internet users have several options today including high bandwidth cellular data services such as 3G, that may be the choice for many. However, the ubiquity and low cost of WiFi suggests an attractive alternative, namely, opportunistic use of open WiFi access points (APs) or planned municipal mesh networks. Unfortunately, for vehicular users, the intermittent nature of WiFi connectivity makes it challenging to support popular interactive applications such as Web search and browsing.</p> <p>Our work is driven by two questions. 1) How can we enable system support for interactive web applications to tolerate disruptions in WiFi connectivity from mobile nodes? 2) Can opportunistic mobile-to-mobile (m2m) transfers enhance application performance over only using APs, and if so, under what conditions and by how much?</p> <p>We present Thedu, a system that enables access to Web search from moving vehicles. The key idea is to use aggressive prefetching to transform the interactive Web search application into a one-shot request/response process. We deployed a prototype of Thedu on the DieselNet testbed in Amherst, MA, consisting of transit buses averaging 21 on the road at a time. Our deployment results show that Thedu can deliver 4 times as many relevant web pages than not using Thedu. A bus receives relevant web pages with a mean delay of 2.3 minutes and within 0.55 minutes in areas with high AP density. Thedu augments AP connectivity with m2m transfers using a utility-driven DTN routing algorithm and uses caching to exploit query locality. Our analytic model and trace-driven simulations suggest that m2m routing yields little benefit over using APs alone even under moderately dense AP deployment such as in Amherst. With sparsely deployed APs as may be the case in rural areas, our conclusions are more mixed: m2m routing with caching improves the number of relevant responses delivered per bus by up to 58%, but the mean delay is significantly high at 6.7 minutes, calling into question its practicality for interactive applications.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Networks composed of mobile nodes inherently suffer from intermittent connections and high delays. Performance can be improved by adding supporting infrastructure, including base stations, meshes, and relays, but the cost-performance trade-offs of different designs is poorly understood. To examine these trade-offs, we have deployed a large-scale vehicular network and three infrastructure enhancement alternatives. The results of these deployments demonstrate some of the advantages of each kind of infrastructure; however, these conclusions can be applied only to other networks of similar characteristics, including size, wireless technologies, and mobility patterns. Thus we complement our deployment with a demonstrably accurate analytical model of large-scale networks in the presence of infrastructure.</p> <p>Based on our deployment and analysis, we make several fundamental observations about infrastructure-enhanced mobile networks. First, if the average packet delivery delay in a vehicular deployment can be reduced by a factor of two by adding <i>x</i> base stations, the same reduction requires 2<i>x</i> mesh nodes or 5<i>x</i> relays. Given the high cost of deploying base stations, relays or mesh nodes can be a more cost-effective enhancement. Second, we observe that adding small amount of infrastructure is vastly superior to even a large number of mobile nodes capable of routing to one another, obviating the need for mobile-to-mobile disruption tolerant routing schemes.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

This problem can be reduced to establishing authentic public keys among all the participants - these public keys then serve to establish a shared secret symmetric key for encryption and authentication of messages. Unfortunately, in most real-world settings, public key infrastructures (PKI) are uncommon and distributing a secret in a public space is difficult. Thus, it is a challenge to exchange authentic public keys in a scalable, secure, and easy to use fashion.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose GAnGS, a protocol for the secure exchange of authenticated information among a group of people. In contrast to prior work, GAnGS resists Group-in-the-Middle and Sybil attacks by malicious insiders, as well as infiltration attacks by malicious bystanders. GAnGS is designed to be robust to user errors, such as miscounting the number of participants or incorrectly comparing checksums. We have implemented and evaluated GAnGS on Nokia N70 phones. The GAnGS system is viable and achieves a good balance between scalability, security, and ease of use.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We explore the use of clock skew of a wireless local area network access point (AP) as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and accurately. The main goal behind using clock skews is to overcome one of the major limitations of existing solutions - the inability to effectively detect Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. We calculate the clock skew of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) timestamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We use two different methods for this purpose - one based on linear programming and the other based on least square fit. We supplement these methods with a heuristic for differentiating original packets from those sent by the fake APs. We collect TSF timestamp data from several APs in two different residential settings. Using our measurement data as well as data obtained from a large conference setting, we find that clock skews remain consistent over time for the same AP but vary significantly across APs. Furthermore, we improve the resolution of received timestamp of the frames and show that with this enhancement our methodology can find clock skews very quickly, using 50-100 packets in most of the cases. We also discuss and quantify the impact of various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization, and NTP synchronization on clock skews. Our results indicate that the use of clock skews appears to be an efficient and robust method for detecting fake APs in wireless local area networks.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Securing communications requires the establishment of cryptographic keys, which is challenging in mobile scenarios where a key management infrastructure is not always present. In this paper, we present a protocol that allows two users to establish a common cryptographic key by exploiting special properties of the wireless channel: the underlying channel response between any two parties is unique and decorrelates rapidly in space. The established key can then be used to support security services (such as encryption) between two users. Our algorithm uses level-crossings and quantization to extract bits from correlated stochastic processes. The resulting protocol resists cryptanalysis by an eavesdropping adversary and a spoofing attack by an active adversary without requiring an authenticated channel, as is typically assumed in prior information-theoretic key establishment schemes. We evaluate our algorithm through theoretical and numerical studies, and provide validation through two complementary experimental studies. First, we use an 802.11 development platform with customized logic that extracts raw channel impulse response data from the preamble of a format-compliant 802.11a packet. We show that it is possible to practically achieve key establishment rates of ~ 1 bit/sec in a real, indoor wireless environment. To illustrate the generality of our method, we show that our approach is equally applicable to per-packet coarse signal strength measurements using off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

Earlier techniques are either limited to undesirable accuracy or rely on specific hardware characteristics that may not be available for certain systems. In this work, we examine the clock synchronization problem in resource-constrained networks such as wireless sensor networks where nodes have limited energy and bandwidth, and also lack the high accuracy oscillators or programmable network interfaces some previous protocols depend on. This paper derives a general model for clock offset and skew and demonstrates its applicability. We design efficient algorithms based on this model to achieve high synchronization accuracy given limited resources. These algorithms apply the Kalman filter to track the clock offset and skew, and adaptively adjust the synchronization interval so that the desired error bounds are achieved. We demonstrate the performance advantages of our schemes through extensive simulations obeying real-world constraints.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

The scheduling resources consist of tiles in a two-dimensional scheduling frame with time slots along one axis, and frequency bands or sub-channels along the other axis. The resource allocation problem has to be solved once every scheduling frame which is about 5 - 10 ms long. While the original scheduling problem is computationally complex, we provide an easy-to-compute upper bound on the optimum. We also propose three fast heuristic algorithms that perform close to the optimum (within 99.5%), and outperform other algorithms such as OFDM<sup>2</sup>A proposed in the past. Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrate the benefits of relaying in throughput enhancement (an improvement in the median throughput of about 25%), and feasibility of range extension (for <i>e.g.</i>, 7 relays can be used to extend the cell-radius by 60% but mean throughput reduces by 36%). Our algorithms are easy to implement, and have an average running time of less than 0.05 ms making them appropriate for WiMAX relay networks.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we study the critical phase transition time of large-scale wireless multi-hop networks when the network topology experiences a partition due to increasing random node failures. We first define two new metrics, namely the <i>last connection time</i> and <i>first partition time</i>. The former is the last time that the network keeps a majority of surviving nodes connected in a single giant component; while the latter is the first time that the remaining surviving nodes are partitioned into multiple small components. Then we analyze the devolution process in a geometric random graph of <i>n</i> nodes based on percolation-theory connectivity and obtain the sufficient condition under which the graph is percolated. Based on the percolation condition, the last connection time and first partition time are found to be on the same order. Particularly, when the survival function of node lifetime is exponential, they are on the order of log(log <i>n</i>); while if the survival function is Pareto, the order is (log <i>n</i>)<sup>1/ρ</sup>, where ρ is the shape parameter of Pareto distribution. Finally, simulation results confirm that the last connection time and first partition time serve as the lower and upper bounds of the critical phase transition time, respectively. Further, an interesting result is that the network with heavy-tailed survival functions is no more resilient to random failures than the network with light-tailed ones, in terms of critical phase transition time, if the expected node lifetimes are identical.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide23" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In order to evaluate, improve, or expand a deployed, city-wide wireless mesh network, it is necessary to assess the network's spatial performance. In this paper, we present a general framework to accurately predict a network's well-served area, termed the metric region, via a small number of measurements. Assessment of deployed networks must address two key issues: non-uniform physical-layer propagation and high spatial variance in performance. Addressing non-uniformity, our framework estimates a mesh node's metric region via a data-driven sectorization of the region. We find each sector's boundary (radius) with a two-stage process of estimation and then measurement-driven "push-pull" refinement of the estimated boundary. To address high spatial variation, our coverage estimation couples signal strength measurements with terrain information from publicly available digital maps to estimate propagation characteristics between a wireless node and the client's location. To limit measurements and yield connected metric regions, we consider performance metrics (such as signal strength) to be monotonic with distance from the wireless node within each sector. We show that despite measured violations in coverage monotonicity, we obtain high accuracy with this assumption. We validate our estimation and refinement framework with measurements from 30,000 client locations obtained in each of two currently operational mesh networks, GoogleWiFi and TFA. We study three illustrative metrics: coverage, modulation rate, and redundancy, and find that to achieve a given accuracy, our framework requires two to five times fewer measurements than grid sampling strategies. Finally, we use the framework to evaluate the two deployments and study the average size and location of their coverage holes as well as the impact of client association policies on load-balancing.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll23" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll23',23)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Cabernet is a system for delivering data to and from moving vehicles using open 802.11 (WiFi) access points encountered opportunistically during travel. Using open WiFi access from the road can be challenging. Network connectivity in Cabernet is both fleeting (access points are typically within range for a few seconds) and intermittent (because the access points do not provide continuous coverage), and suffers from high packet loss rates over the wireless channel. On the positive side, WiFi data transfers, when available, can occur at broadband speeds.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce two new components for improving openWiFi data delivery to moving vehicles: The first, QuickWiFi, is a streamlined client-side process to establish end-to-end connectivity, reducing mean connection time to less than 400 ms, from over 10 seconds when using standard wireless networking software. The second part, CTP, is a transport protocol that distinguishes congestion on the wired portion of the path from losses over the wireless link, resulting in a 2x throughput improvement over TCP. To characterize the amount of open WiFi capacity available to vehicular users, we deployed Cabernet on a fleet of 10 taxis in the Boston area. The long-term average transfer rate achieved was approximately 38 Mbytes/hour per car (86 kbit/s), making Cabernet a viable system for a number of non-interactive applications.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We present an experimental characterization of the physical and MAC layers in CDMA 1xEV-DO and their impact on transport layer performance. The 1xEV-DO network is currently the fastest mobile broadband cellular network, offering data rates of up to 3.1 Mbps for both stationary and mobile users. These rates are achieved by using novel capacity enhancement techniques at the lower layers. Specifically, 1xEV-DO incorporates rapid channel rate adaptation in response to signal conditions, and opportunistic scheduling to exploit channel fluctuations. Although shown to perform well in isolation, there is no comprehensive literature that examines the impact of these features on transport layer and application performance in real networks.</p> <p>We take the first step in addressing this issue through a large set of experiments conducted on a commercial 1xEV-DO network. Our evaluation includes both stationary and mobile scenarios wherein we transferred data using four popular transport protocols: TCPReno, TCP-Vegas, TCP-Westwood, and TCP-Cubic, and logged detailed measurements about wireless channel level characteristics as well as transport layer performance. We analyzed data from several days of experiments and inferred the properties of the physical, MAC and transport layers, as well as potential interactions between them. We find that the wireless channel data rate shows significant variability over long time scales on the order of hours, but retains high memory and predictability over small time scales on the order of milliseconds. We also find that loss-based TCP variants are largely unaffected by channel variations due to the presence of large buffers, and hence able to achieve in excess of 80% of the system capacity.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

Specifically, we identify factors that degrade overall performance and reliability with a focus on the physical layer, and we explore the degree to which reader configuration options can mitigate these factors. We use a custom software-radio based RFID monitoring system and configurable RFID readers to gather fine-grained data and assess the effects of the different factors. We find that physical layer considerations have a significant impact on reader performance, and that this is exacerbated by a lack of integration between the physical and MAC layers. We show that tuning physical layer operating parameters can increase the read rate for a set of tags by more than a third. Additionally, we show that tighter integration of the physical and MAC layers has the potential for even greater improvements.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

Most existing solutions require nodes to overhear transmissions made by contending nodes and, based on the overheard information, adjust local rates to achieve fairness among all contending links. Their underlying assumption is that transmissions made by contending nodes can be overheard. However, this assumption holds only when the transmission range is equal to the carrier sensing range, which is not true in reality. As our study reveals, the overhearing-based solutions, as well as several non-overhearing AIMD solutions, cannot achieve MAC-layer fairness in various settings. We propose a new rate control protocol, called PISD (Proportional Increase Synchronized multiplicative Decrease). Without relying on overhearing, it provides fairness in CSMA/CA networks, particularly IEEE 802.11 networks, by using only local information and performing localized operations. It combines several novel rate control mechanisms, including synchronized multiplicative decrease, proportional increase, and background transmission. We prove that PISD converges and achieves (weighted) fairness.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>There has been extensive work on network architectures that support multi-path routing to improve performance in wireless mesh networks. However, previous work uses ad-hoc design principles that cannot guarantee any network-wide performance objectives such as conjointly maximizing resource utilization and improving fairness. In parallel, numerous theoretical results have addressed the issue of optimizing a combined metric of network utilization and fairness using techniques based on back-pressure scheduling, routing and flow control. However, the proposed theoretical algorithms are extremely difficult to implement in practice, especially in the presence of the 802.11 MAC and TCP. We propose Horizon, a novel system design for multi-path forwarding in wireless meshes, based on the theoretical results on back-pressure. Our design works with an unmodified TCP stack and on top of the existing 802.11 MAC. We modified the back-pressure approach to obtain a simple 802.11-compatible packet-forwarding heuristic and a novel, light-weight path estimator, while maintaining global optimality properties. We propose a delayed reordering algorithm that eliminates TCP timeouts while keeping TCP packet reordering to a minimum. We have evaluated our implementation on a 22-node testbed. We have shown that Horizon effectively utilizes available resources (disjoint paths). In contrast to previous work, our design not only avoids bottlenecks but also optimally load-balances traffic across them when needed, improving fairness among competing flows. To our knowledge, Horizon is the first practical wireless system based on back-pressure.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide30" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We consider the problem of efficientMAC design for long-distance WiFi-based mesh networks. In such networks it is common to find long propagation delays, the use of directional antennas, and the presence of inter-link interference. Prior work has shown that these characteristics make traditional CSMA-based MACs a poor choice for long-distance mesh networks and this finding has led to several recent research efforts exploring the use of TDMA-based approaches to media access. In this paper we first identify, and then address, several shortcomings of current TDMA-based proposals. First, because they use fixed-length transmission slots, current TDMA-based solutions do not adapt to dynamic variations in traffic load leading to inefficiencies in both throughput and delay. As we show in this paper, the throughput achieved by existing solutions falls far short of the optimal achievable network throughput. Finally, due to the scheduling constraints imposed by inter-link interference, current TDMA-based solutions only apply to bipartite network topologies.</p> <p>In this paper, we present JazzyMac, a simple, practical and efficient MAC protocol that addresses the above limitations. JazzyMac achieves efficiency by allowing variable-length link transmissions slots and then defining a distributed protocol by which nodes adapt the length of their transmission slots to changing traffic demands. JazzyMac is practical in that the adaptation at each node uses purely local information and that our protocol applies to arbitrary network topologies. Finally, the use of dynamic slot sizes allows JazzyMac to achieve better tradeoffs between throughput and delay.</p> <p>We evaluate JazzyMac using detailed simulation over a range of traffic patterns and realistic topologies. Our results show that JazzyMac improves throughput in all considered scenarios. This improvement is often substantial (e.g.,in 50% of our scenarios, throughput improves by over 40%) and is particularly pronounced for the common case of asymmetric traffic (e.g.,leading to almost 100% improvements). Furthermore, compared to current solutions, JazzyMac can achieve much better average delay for the same throughput.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide31" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper establishes a framework for the automated generation of networking protocols. The need for the rapid design of networking protocols in application-specific contexts has increased dramatically over the past five years. Each new application requires high performance in its own domain, as well as a rapid design cycle. Further, changes in physical layer technology quickly render previously high-performance protocols poor performance. Currently, there are no tools to automate the design of networking protocols. This paper addresses the challenge of building such tools. It proposes a methodology and a design chain for the automated generation of networking protocols, with the following novel ideas: (1) Formulation of the network protocol problem such that the exchange of protocol control information can be specified as part of the optimization program, (2) Optimal waveform generation, which specifies the optimal exchange of both control information and data, (3) Protocol Extraction: The extraction of the optimal protocol as a minimal description of the optimal waveforms. This methodology has the potential to dramatically change the future of networking protocol design by moving protocol design to a more abstract level, finding high-performance protocols not easily discovered by human intuition, and reducing the currently long protocol design cycles.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll31" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll31',31)">expand</a>

While mesh networks have been proposed as a way to provide cheap, easily deployable Internet access, they must maintain high transfer throughput to be able to compete with other last-mile technologies. Unfortunately, doing so is difficult because multi-hop wireless transmissions interfere with each other, reducing the available capacity on the network. This problem is particularly severe in common gateway-based scenarios in which nearly all transmissions go through one or a few gateways from the mesh network to the Internet.</p> <p>Ditto exploits on-path as well as opportunistic caching based on overhearing to improve the throughput of data transfers and to reduce load on the gateways. It uses content-based naming to provide application independent caching at the granularity of small chunks, a feature that is key to being able to cache partially overheard data transfers. Our evaluation of Ditto shows that it can achieve significant performance gains for cached data, increasing throughput by up to 7x over simpler on-path caching schemes, and by up to an order of magnitude over no caching.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

Since TCP does not explicitly account for this, starvation and unfairness can result from the use of TCP over such networks. In this paper, we explore mechanisms for achieving fair and efficient congestion control for multi-hop wireless mesh networks. First, we design an AIMD-based rate-control protocol called Wireless Control Protocol (WCP) which recognizes that wireless congestion is a neighborhood phenomenon, not a node-local one, and appropriately reacts to such congestion. Second, we design a distributed rate controller that estimates the available capacity within each neighborhood, and divides this capacity to contending flows, a scheme we call Wireless Control Protocol with Capacity estimation (WCPCap). Using analysis, simulations, and real deployments, we find that our designs yield rates that are both fair and efficient, and achieve near optimal goodputs for all the topologies that we study. WCP achieves this level of performance while being extremely easy to implement. Moreover, WCPCap achieves the max-min rates for our topologies, while still being distributed and amenable to real implementation.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

To achieve high throughput despite highly unpredictable and lossy wireless channels, it is essential that such networks take advantage of transmission opportunities wherever they emerge. However, as opportunistic routing departs from the traditional but less effective deterministic, shortest-path based routing, user nodes in such networks may have less incentive to follow protocols and contribute. In this paper, we present the first routing protocols in which it is incentive-compatible for each user node to honestly participate in the routing despite opportunistic transmissions. We not only rigorously prove the properties of our protocols but also thoroughly evaluate a complete implementation of our protocols. Experiments show that there is a 5.8%-58.0% gain in throughput when compared with an opportunistic routing protocol that does not provide incentives and users can act selfishly.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

Our evaluation reveals that SNR-triggered protocols are susceptible to overselection from the ideal rate when the coherence time is low (a scenario that we show occurs in practice even in a nonmobile topology), and that "in-situ" training can produce large gains to overcome this sensitivity. Another key finding is that a mechanism effective in differentiating between collision and fading losses for hidden terminals has severely imbalanced throughput sharing when competing links are even slightly heterogeneous. In general, we find trained SNR-based protocols outperform loss-based protocols in terms of the ability to track vehicular clients, accuracy within outdoor environments, and balanced sharing with heterogeneous links (even with physical layer capture).</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide38" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>A primary focus of popular wireless link-layer protocols is to achieve some level of reliability using ARQ or Hybrid ARQ mechanisms. However, these and other leading link-layer protocols largely ignore the stability aspect of wireless communication, and rely on higher layers to provide stable traffic flow control. This design strategy has led to a great deal of inefficiency in throughput and to other major issues (such as the well-known TCP over-wireless performance degradation phenomenon and the numerous studies in attempt to fix it). In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift where both reliability and stability are targeted using an Automatic Code Embedding (ACE) wireless link-layer protocol. To the best of our knowledge this is the first effort to develop a theoretical framework for analyzing and designing a wireless link-layer protocol that targets system stability in conjunction with reliable communication. We present two distinct analytical frameworks to determine optimal code embedding rates which ensure system reliability and stability for wide range of traffic demand. An important conclusion of our analysis is that various traffic demand can be met using a packet-by-packet code embedding rate constraint that is independent of traffic type. We demonstrate experimentally that ACE provides both rapid and reliable point-to-point wireless data transmission for realtime and non-realtime traffic over real channel traces collected on 802.11b WLAN. We also have conducted extensive TCP simulations in conjunction with ACE; and we demonstrate the high level of efficiency and stability that can be achieved for TCP over ACE, while not making any changes to TCP. Further, the implementation of ACE for real-time video communication shows performance gains of 5-10dB over IEEE ARQ schemes. More importantly, ACE is layer oblivious and requires no changes to higher or lower PHY layers.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

To address these limitations, we explore the notion of interference cancellation for unmanaged networks - the ability for a single receiver to disambiguate and successfully receive simultaneous overlapping transmissions from multiple unsynchronized sources. We describe a practical algorithm for interference cancellation, and implement it for ZigBee using software radios. In this setting, we find that our techniques can reduce packet loss rate and substantially increase spatial reuse. With carrier sense set to prevent concurrent sends, our approach reduces the packet loss rate during collisions from 14% to 8% due to improved handling of hidden terminals. Conversely, disabling carrier sense reduces performance for only 7% of all pairs of links and increases the delivery rate for the median pair of links in our testbed by a factor of 1.8 due to improved spatial reuse.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide40" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Current wireless protocols retransmit any packet that fails the checksum test, even when most of the bits are correctly received. Prior work has recognized this inefficiency, however the proposed solutions (e.g., PPR, HARQ and SOFT) require changes to the hardware and physical layer, and hence are not usable in today's WLANs and mesh networks. They are further tested in channels with fixed modulation and coding, whereas production 802.11 networks adapt their modulation and codes to maximize their ability to correct erroneous bits.</p> <p>This paper makes two key contributions: 1) it introduces ZipTx, a software-only solution that harvests the gains from using correct bits in corrupted packets using existing hardware, and 2) it characterizes the true gains of partially correct packets for the entire range of operation of 802.11 networks, and in the presence of adaptive modulation and error correcting codes. We implement ZipTx as a driver extension and evaluate our implementation in both outdoor and indoor environments, showing that ZipTx significantly improves the throughput.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll40" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll40',40)">expand</a>
