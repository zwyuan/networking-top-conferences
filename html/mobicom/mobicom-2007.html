<span id="toHide1" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobility in networks arises both as mobility of packets and mobility of nodes. In a wireless setting, packets move under network control to meet desiderata of low latency, high throughput, load-balancing, energy conservation, etc. Nodes, though, often move under the influence of forces unrelated to the network state, necessitating the continuous adaptation of supporting network structures. In order to understand how to best design such structures, it is important to study the stability of various network mechanisms under node motion, as well as under other kinds of variability in the network, such as wireless link volatility.</p> <p>Since networks are embedded in the physical world (sometimes in order to monitor this very world, as in sensor networks) and node motion happens under physical laws, geometric and topological methods can be useful in understanding global structures that can affect network performance. In this talk we give a number of examples of such methods, such as the use of kinetic data structures in clustering mobile nodes and the use of topological complexes for capturing the global structure of a static network with the goal of designing efficient routing protocols.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll1" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll1',1)">expand</a>

Each scheduling decision involves constructing a frame of one or more time slots. Within each time slot <i>multiple</i> carriers must be assigned to users. The important aspect of our problem is that a scheduler knows the channel rates across all users and all carriers whenever a scheduling decision is made. Hence there is no need to treat each carrier in complete isolation. This gives a potential for enhancing performance by allocating multiple carriers simultaneously.</p> <p>We analyze this problem in a situation where finite queues are fed by a data arrival process. We generalize the well-known <i>MaxWeight</i> algorithm for the single-carrier setting to accommodate a number of natural optimization problems in the multi-carrier setting. We state the hardness of these problems and present simple algorithmic solutions with provable performance bounds. We also validate our algorithms via numerical examples.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this study we consider optimal opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) policies for a transmitter in a multichannel wireless system, where a channel can be in one of multiple states. Each channel state is associated with either a probability of transmission success or a transmission rate. In such systems, the transmitter typically has partial information concerning the channel states, but can deduce more by probing individual channels, e.g. by sending control packets in the channels, at the expense of certain resources, e.g., energy and time. The main goal of this work is to derive optimal strategies for determining which channels to probe (in what sequence) and which channel to use for transmission. We consider two problems within this context,allthe constant data time (CDT) and the constant access time (CAT) problems. For both problems, we derive key structural properties of the corresponding optimal strategy. In particular, we show that it has a threshold structure and can be described by an index policy. We further show that the optimal CDT strategy can only take on one of three structural forms. Using these results we present a two-step lookahead CDT (CAT) strategy. This strategy is shown to be optimal for a number of cases of practical interest. We examine its performance under a class of practical channel models via numerical studies.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we study the coverage problem for hybrid networks which comprise both static and mobile sensors. We consider mobile sensors with limited mobility, i.e., they can move only once over a short distance. Such mobiles are simple and cheap compared to sophisticated mobile robots. In conventional static sensor networks, for a random deployment, the sensor density should increase as <i>O</i>(log <i>L</i> + <i>k</i> log log <i>L</i>) to provide <i>k</i>-coverage in a network with a size of <i>L</i>. As an alternative, an all mobile sensor network can provide <i>k</i>-coverage over the field with a constant density of <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>), independent of network size <i>L</i>. We show that the maximum distance that any mobile sensor will have to move is <i>O</i>(1 over √<i>k</i> log <sup>3 over 4</sup> (<i>kL</i>)). We then propose a hybrid network structure, comprising static sensors and a small fraction of <i>O</i>(1 over √(<i>k</i>)) of mobile sensors. For this network structure, we prove that <i>k</i>-coverage is achievable with a constant sensor density of <i>O</i>(<i>k</i>), independent of network size <i>L</i>. Furthermore, for this hybrid structure, we prove that the maximum distance which any mobile sensor has to move is bounded as <i>O</i>(log<sup>3 over 4</sup> <i>L</i>). We then propose a distributed relocation algorithm, where each mobile sensor only requires local information in order to optimally relocate itself and characterize the algorithm's computational complexity and message overhead. Finally, we verify our analysis via extensive numerical evaluations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

Current localization approaches can be divided into two groups: range-based and range-free. Due to the high costs and critical as-sumptions, the range-based schemes are often impractical for WSNs. The existing range-free schemes, on the other hand, suffer from poor accuracy and low scalability. Without the help of a large number of uniformly deployed seed nodes, those schemes fail in anisotropic WSNs with possible holes. To address this issue, we propose the Rendered Path (REP) protocol.

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Global barrier coverage that requires much fewer sensors than full coverage, is known to be an appropriate model of coverage for movement detection applications such as intrusion detection. However, it has been proved that given a sensor deployment, sensors can not locally determine whether the deployment provides global barrier coverage, making it impossible to develop localized algorithms, thus limiting its use in practice.</p> <p>In this paper, we introduce the concept of <i>local barrier coverage</i> to address this limitation. Motivated by the observation that movements are likely to follow a shorter path in crossing a belt region, local barrier coverage guarantees the detection of all movements whose trajectory is confined to a slice of the belt region of deployment. We prove that it is possible for individual sensors to locally determine the existence of local barrier coverage, even when the region of deployment is arbitrarily curved. Although local barrier coverage does not always guarantee global barrier coverage, we show that for thin belt regions, local barrier coverage almost always provides global barrier coverage. To demonstrate that local barrier coverage can be used to design localized algorithms, we develop a novel sleep-wakeup algorithm for maximizing the network lifetime, called <i>Localized Barrier Coverage Protocol (LBCP)</i>. We show that LBCP provides close to optimalenhancement in network lifetime, while providing global barrier coverage most of the time. It outperforms an existing algorithm called Randomized Independent Sleeping (RIS) by up to 6 times.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Deriving the critical density (which is equivalent to deriving the critical radius or power) to achieve coverage and/or connectivity for random deployments is a fundamental problem in the area of wireless networks. The probabilistic conditions normally derived, however, have limited appeal among practitioners because they areoften asymptotic, i.e., they only make high probability guarantees in the limit of large system sizes. Such conditions are not very useful in practice since deployment regions are always finite. Another major limitation of most existing work on coverage and connectivity is their focus on thick deployment regions (such as a square or a disk). There is no existing work (including traditional percolation theory) that derives critical densities for thin strips (or annuli).</p> <p>In this paper, we address both of these shortcomings by introducing new techniques for deriving reliable density estimates for finite regions (including thin strips). We apply our techniques to solve the open problem of deriving reliable density estimates for achieving <i>barrier coverage</i> and connectivity in thin strips, where sensors are deployed as a barrier to detect moving objects and phenomena. We use simulations to show that our estimates are accurate even for small deployment regions. Our techniques bridge the gap between theory and practice in the area of coverage and connectivity, since the results can now be readily used in real-life deployments.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll12" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll12',12)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile ad-hoc networks are deployed under the assumption that participating nodes are willing to forward other nodes' packets. In reputation-based mechanisms cooperation is induced by means of a threat of partial or total disconnection from the network if a node is non-cooperative; however packet collisions and interference may make cooperative nodes appear selfish sometimes. In this paper we use a simple network model to first study the performance of some proposed reputation strategies and then present a new mechanism that we call DARWIN (Distributed and Adaptive Reputation mechanism for WIreless ad-hoc Networks). The idea is to avoid a retaliation situation after a node has been falsely perceived as selfish so cooperation can be restored quickly. We prove that our strategy is robust to imperfect measurements, is collusion-resistant and can achieve full cooperation among nodes.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

Each 802.11 device transmits a globally unique and persistent MAC address and thus is trivially identifiable. In response, recent research has proposed replacing such identifiers with pseudonyms (i.e., temporary, unlinkable names). In this paper, we demonstrate that pseudonyms are insufficient to prevent tracking of 802.11 devices because implicit identifiers, or identifying characteristics of 802.11 traffic, can identify many users with high accuracy. For example, even without unique names and addresses, we estimate that an adversary can identify 64% of users with 90% accuracy when they spend a day at a busy hot spot. We present an automated procedure based on four previously unrecognized <i>implicit identifiers</i> that can identify users in three real 802.11 traces even when pseudonyms and encryption are employed. We find that the majority of users can be identified using our techniques, but our ability to identify users is not uniform; some users are not easily identifiable. Nonetheless, we show that even a single implicit identifier is sufficient to distinguish many users. Therefore, we argue that design considerations beyond eliminating explicit identifiers (i.e., unique names and addresses), must be addressed in order to prevent user tracking in wireless networks.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

In this paper, we propose using a measured temporal link signature to uniquely identify the link between a transmitter and a receiver. When the transmitter changes location, or if an attacker at a different location assumes the identity of the transmitter, the proposed link distinction algorithm reliably detects the change in the physical channel. This detection can be performed at a single receiver or collaboratively by multiple receivers.

In this paper, we considerhow to increase the efficiency of the paging scheme.</p> <p>Much previous work has relied on simulation or modeling to design and evaluate the performance of proposed paging schemes. We take a different, data-driven approach in how we design and evaluate our solution. Specifically, we mine more than 300 million call records from a large cellular operator to characterize user mobility and create mobility profiles. We then develop a family ofprofile-based paging techniques, considering both static schemes and dynamic schemes which adapt as user profiles continuously get updated. We find that our paging techniques can dramatically reducesignaling load (up to 80%) with minimal increase in paging delay (usually less than 10%).</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Recently, network coding emerged as a promising technology that can provide significant improvements in throughput and energy efficiency of wireless networks, even for unicast communication. Often, network coding schemes are designed as an autonomous layer, independent of the underlying Phy and MAC capabilities and algorithms.Consequently, these schemes are greedy, in the sense that all opportunities of broadcasting combinations of packets are exploited. We demonstrate that this greedy design principle may in fact reduce the network throughput. This begets the need for adaptive network coding schemes. We further show that designing appropriate MAC scheduling algorithms is critical for achieving the throughput gainsexpected from network coding. In this paper, we propose a general framework to develop optimal and adaptive joint network coding and scheduling schemes. Optimality is shown for various Phy and MAC constraints. We apply this framework to two different network coding architectures: COPE, a scheme recently proposed in [7], and XOR-Sym, a new scheme we present here. XOR-Sym is designed to achieve a lower implementation complexity than that of COPE, and yet to provide similar throughput gains.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Inter-meeting time between mobile nodes is one of the key metrics in a Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) and central to the end-to-end delay and forwarding algorithms. It is typically assumed to be exponentially distributed in many performance studies of MANET or numerically shown to be exponentially distributed under most existing mobility models in the literature. However, recent empirical results show otherwise: the inter-meeting time distribution in fact follows a power-law. This outright discrepancy potentially undermines our understanding of the performance tradeoffs in MANET obtained under the exponential distribution ofthe inter-meeting time, and thus calls for further study on the power-law inter-meeting time including its fundamental cause, mobility modeling, and its effect. In this paper, we rigorously prove that a <i>finite domain</i>, on which most of the current mobility models are defined, plays an important role in creating the exponential tail of the inter-meeting time. We also prove that by simply removing the boundary in a simple two-dimensional isotropic random walk model, we are able to obtain the empirically observed power-law decay of the inter-meeting time. We then discuss the relationship between the size of the boundary and the relevant time scale of the network scenario under consideration. Our results thus provide guidelines on the design of new mobility models with power-law inter-meeting time distribution, new protocols including packet forwarding algorithms, as well as their performance analysis.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

Our model is based on measurements from the underlying network itself and is thus more accurate than abstract models of RF propagation such as those based on distance. The seed measurements are easy to gather, requiring only <i>O(N)</i> measurements in an <i>N</i>-node networks. Compared to existing measurement-based models, our model advances the state of the art in three important ways. First, it goes beyond pairwise interference and models interference among an arbitrary number of senders. Second, it goes beyond broadcast transmissions and models the more common case of unicast transmissions. Third, it goes beyond homogeneous nodes and models the general case of heterogeneous nodes with different traffic demands and different radio characteristics. Using simulations and measurements from two different wireless testbeds, we show that the predictions of our model are accurate in a wide range of scenarios.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We examine the fundamental properties that determine the basic performance metrics for opportunistic communications. We first consider the distribution of inter-contact times between mobile devices. Using a diverse set of measured mobility traces, we find as an invariant property that there is a characteristic time, order of half a day, beyond which the distribution decays exponentially. Up to this value, the distribution in many cases follows a power law, as shown in recent work. This powerlaw finding was previously used to support the hypothesis that inter-contact time has a power law tail, and that common mobility models are not adequate. However, we observe that the time scale of interest for opportunistic forwarding may be of the same order as the characteristic time, and thus the exponential tail is important. We further show that already simple models such as random walk and random way point can exhibit the same dichotomy in the distribution of inter-contact time ascin empirical traces. Finally, we perform an extensive analysis of several properties of human mobility patterns across several dimensions, and we present empirical evidence that the return time of a mobile device to its favorite location site may already explain the observed dichotomy. Our findings suggest that existing results on the performance of forwarding schemes basedon power-law tails might be overly pessimistic.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

As buses travel their routes, they encounter other buses and in some cases are able to establish pair-wise connections and transfer data between them. We analyze the bus-to-bus contact traces to characterize the contact process between buses and its impact on DTN routing performance. We find that the all-bus-pairs aggregated inter-contact times show no discernible pattern. However, the inter-contact times aggregated at a route level exhibit periodic behavior.Based on analysis of the deterministic inter-meeting times for bus pairs running on route pairs, and consideration of the variability in bus movement and the random failures to establish connections, we construct generative route-level models that capture the above behavior. Through trace-driven simulations of epidemic routing, we find that the epidemic performance predicted by traces generated with this finer-grained route-level model is much closer to the actual performance that would be realized in the operational system than traces generated using the coarse-grained all-bus-pairs aggregated model. This suggests the importance in choosing the rightlevel of model granularity when modelingmobility-related measures such as inter-contact times in DTNs.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide31" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The protocols used in ad hoc networks today are based on the assumption that the best way to approach multiple access interference (MAI) is to avoid it. Unfortunately, as the seminal work by Gupta and Kumar has shown, this approach does not scale. Recently, Ahlswede, Ning, Li, and Yeung showed that network coding (NC) can attain the max-flow min-cut throughput for multicast applications in directed graphs with point-to-point links. Motivated by this result, many researchers have attempted to make ad hoc networks scale using NC. However, the work by Liu, Goeckel, and Towsley has shown that NC does not increase the order capacity of wireless ad hoc networks for multi-pair unicast applications. We demonstrate that protocol architectures that exploit multi-packet reception (MPR) <i>do</i> increase the order capacity of random wireless ad hoc networks by a factor Θ(log <i>n</i>) under the protocol model. We also show that MPR provides a better capacity improvement for ad hoc networks than NC when the network experiences a single-source multicast and multi-pair unicasts. Based on these results, we introduce design problems for channel access and routing based on MPR, such that nodes communicate with one another on a many-to-many basis, rather than one-to-one as it is done today, in order to make ad hoc networks truly scalable.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll31" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll31',31)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide32" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In the context of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), a number of highly promising convenience applications have been proposed. These include collecting and distributing information on the traffic situation, distributed monitoring of road and weather conditions, and finding available parking places in a distributed, cooperative manner. Unfortunately, all of these applications face major problems when a VANET is used as a means to distribute the required information. In particular a large number of vehicles needs to be equipped with dedicated VANET technology before these applications can provide a useful service. Even if customers were willing to purchase a system which is not immediately useful, it would still take quite some time until the required density of equipped cars is reached. In contrast, affordable always-on mobile Internet access is already mainstream. Such Internet connectivity could be used to build the proposed applications in a different fashion: by using peer-to-peer communication, essentially creating a peer-to-peer network of cars sharing traffic information. This allows to overcome the limitations of VANETs, while it preserves their key benefits of decentralization and robustness. In this paper, we describe the technical challenges that arise from such an approach, point out relevant research directions, and outline possible starting points for solutions.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

In addition, they usually require the tracked device to participate actively in the localization process. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Device-free Passive (DfP) localization. A DfP system is envisioned to be able to detect, track, and identify entities that do not carry any device, nor participate actively in the localization process. The system works by monitoring and processing changes in the received physical signals at one or more monitoring points to detect changes in the environment. Applications for DfP systems include intrusion detection and <i>tracking</i>, protecting outdoor assets, such as pipelines, railroad tracks, and perimeters.</p> <p>We describe the DfP system's architecture and the challenges that need to be addressed to materialize a DfP system. We show the feasibility of the system by describing algorithms for implementing different functionalities of a DfP system that works with nominal WiFi equipment. We present two techniques for intrusion detection and a technique for tracking a single intruder. Our results show that the system can achieve very high probability of detection and tracking with very few false positives. We also identify different research directions for addressing the challenges of realizing a DfP system.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide36" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In many delay tolerant applications, information is opportunistically exchanged between mobile devices who encounter each other. In order to effect such information exchange, mobile devices must have knowledge of other devices in their vicinity. We consider scenarios in which there is no infrastructure and devices must probe their environment to discover other devices. This can be an extremely energy consuming process and highlights the need for energy conscious contact probing mechanisms. If devices probe very infrequently, they might miss many of their contacts. On the other hand, frequent contact probing might be energy inefficient. In this paper, we investigate the trade-off between the probability of missing a contact and the contact probing frequency. First, via theoretical analysis, we characterize the trade-off between the probability of a missed contact and the contact probing interval for stationary processes. Next, for time varying contact arrival rates, we provide an optimization framework to compute the optimal contact probing interval as a function of the arrival rate. We characterize real world contact patterns via Bluetooth phone contact logging experiments and show that the contact arrival process is self-similar. We design STAR, a contact probing algorithm which adapts to the contact arrival process. Via trace driven simulations on our experimental data, we show that STAR consumes three times less energy when compared to a constant contact probing interval scheme.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll36" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll36',36)">expand</a>

Central to our modeling approach is a MAC-layer model for 802.11 that is fed by PHY-layer models for deferral and packet capture behaviors, which in turn are profiled based on measurements. The target network to be evaluated needs only O(N) measurement steps to gather metrics for individual links that seed the models. We provide two solution approaches - one based on direct simulation (slow, but accurate) and the other based on analytical methods (faster, but approximate). We present elaborate validation results for a 12 node 802.11b mesh network using upto 5 interfering transmissions. We demonstrate, using as comparison points three simpler modeling approaches, that the accuracy of our approach is much better, predicting link capacities with errors within 10% of the base channel datarate for about 90% of the cases.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide38" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Dense deployments of WLANs suffer from increased interference and as a result, reduced capacity. There are three main functions used to improve the overall network capacity: a) intelligent frequency allocation across APs, b) load-balancing of user affiliations across APs, and c) adaptive power-control for each AP. Several algorithms have been proposed in each category, but so far, their evaluation has been limited to: (a) each approach in isolation and, (b)simulations or small-scale testbeds. In this paper, we ask the question: what is the best way to combine these different functions? Our focus is to fully explore the interdependencies between the three functions in order to understand when and how to deploy them on a network. We follow a measurement-driven study to quantify the effects of three previously proposed optimization schemes (one for each category) on a relatively large testbed and in many different scenarios. Surprisingly, we find that blindly applying all the three optimization schemes is not always preferable; it can sometimes degrade the performance by as much as 24% compared to using only two of the schemes. We discover that there are explicit conditions that are conducive for applying specific combinations of the optimization schemes. We capture those conditions within a comprehensive framework, which we call MDG (Measurement-Driven Guidelines). While we derive suchguidelines based on measurements on one experimental testbed, we test their applicability and efficacy on a second testbed in a different location. We show that our framework improves network capacity consistently acrossboth testbeds, with improvements ranging from 22% to 142% with 802.11a, and 103% to 274% with 802.11g.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

We show that the total multicast capacity is Θ(√<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i> dot <i>W</i> over √ <i>k</i>) when <i>k</i> = Ω(<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i>); the total multicast capacity is Θ(<i>W</i>) when <i>k</i> =Θ(<i>n</i> over log <i>n</i>). Our bounds unify the previous capacity bounds on unicast (when <i>k</i>=2) by Gupta and Kumar [7]and the capacity bounds on broadcast (when <i>k</i>=<i>n</i>) in [11,20]. We also study the capacity of group-multicast for wireless networks where for each source node, we randomly select <i>k</i>-1 groups of nodes as receivers and the nodes in each group are within a constant hops from the group leader. The same asymptotic upper bounds and lower bounds still hold. For arbitrary networks, we provide a constructive lower bound Ω(√<i>n</i> over √<i>k</i> dot <i>W</i>) for aggregated multicast capacity when we can carefully place nodes and schedule node transmissions.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll41" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll41',41)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide42" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In wireless ad hoc networks, routing requires cooperation of nodes. Since nodes often belong to different users, it is highly important to provide incentives for them to cooperate. However, most existing studies of the incentive-compatible routing problem focus on individual nodes' incentives, assuming that no subset of them would collude. Clearly, this assumption is not always valid. In this paper, we present a systematic study of collusion resistance in incentive-compatible routing schemes. In particular, we consider two standard solution concepts for collusion resistance in game theory, namely Group Strategyproofness and Strong Nash Equilibrium. We show that achieving Group Strategyproofness is impossible while achieving Strong Nash Equilibrium is possible. More specifically, we design a scheme that is guaranteed to converge to a Strong Nash Equilibrium. In addition, we give a cryptographic method that prevents profit transfer between colluding nodes, as long as they do not fullytrust each other unconditionally. This method makes our scheme widely applicable in practice. Experiments show that our solution is collusion-resistant and has good performance.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide43" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Routing in communication networks involves the <i>indirection</i> from a <i>persistent name</i> (or ID) to a <i>locator</i> and delivering packets based upon the locator. In a large-scale, highly dynamic network, the ID-to-locator mappings are both large in number, and change often. Traditional routing protocols require high overhead to keep these in directions up-to-date. In this paper, we propose Weak State Routing (WSR), a routing mechanism for large-scale highly dynamic networks. WSR's novelty is that it uses random directional walks biased occasionally by weak indirection state information in intermediate nodes. The indirection state information is <i>weak</i>, i.e. interpreted not as absolute truth, but as <i>probabilistic hints</i>. Nodes only have partial information about the region a destination node is likely to be. This method allows us to <i>aggregate</i> information about a number of remote locations in a geographic region. In other words, the state information maps a <i>set-of-IDs</i> to a it <i>geographical region</i>. The intermediate nodes receiving the random walk use a method similar to longest-prefix-match in order to prioritize their mappings to decide how to bias and forward the random walk. WSR can also be viewed as an unstructured distributed hashing technique. WSR displays good rare-object recall with scalability properties similar to structured DHTs, albeit with more tolerance to dynamism and without constraining the degree distribution of the underlying network.</p> <p>Through simulations, we show that WSR offers a high packet delivery ratio, more than 98%. The control packet overhead incurred in the network scales as <i>O</i>(<i>N</i>) for <i>N</i>-node networks. The number of mappings stored in the network appears to scale as Θ(<i>N</i><sup>(3/2)</sup>). We compare WSR with Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and geographic forwarding (GPSR) combined with Grid Location Service (GLS). Our results indicate that WSR delivers more packets with less overhead at the cost of increased path length.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll43',43)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide45" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We revisit the problem of computing the path with the minimum cost in terms of the expected number of link layer retransmissions in wireless mesh networks. Unlike previous efforts (such as the popular ETX) we account for the fact that link layer protocols (such as the IEEE 802.11 MAC) incorporate a non-zero but finite number of retransmission attempts per packet. A key observation that motivates this work is that the performance of a path depends not only on the number of links on the path and their qualities, but also on the <b><i>relative positions</i></b> of the links on the path. In particular, the closer a lossy link to the destination, the higher is its impact on the performance of that path. We design a new path metricthat captures all of the above factors and we call this metric ETOP. In this paper, we provide a synopsis of the analytical computation of ETOP. We also implement a routing strategy based on ETOP on a 25-node experimental testbed and provide sample results to showcase the performance with ETOP.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll45" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll45',45)">expand</a>

In this paper, we introduce and analyze a specific instance of the rich set of problems in this domain. We consider a wireless network serving real-time flows in which the underlying physical layer provides multiple transmission rates. Higher rates have more stringent SINR requirements and thus represent a trade-off between raw transmission speed and packet error rate. We adopt a first principles approach to the design of optimal real-time scheduling algorithms for such a multi-rate wireless network. We illustrate the inherent complexities of the problem through examples and obtain provably optimal structural results. We then characterize the optimal policy for an approximate model. Our theoretical analysis provides guidelines for heuristic scheduler design. Our initial work indicates that this is a rich problem domain with the potential for a unifying theory that integrates real-time requirements into multi-rate wireless network design.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll48" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll48',48)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide50" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Recently, a new notion of cooperation was proposed to solve multi-channel coordination problems. When a transmit-receive pair wishes to initiate communication, neighboring nodes share their knowledge of channel usage. This helps to substantially reduce collisions and increases throughput significantly. However, it comes at the cost of increased energy consumption since idle nodes have to stay awake to overhear and acquire channel usage information. In fact this can be as high as 264% of a power-saving protocol without cooperation. In this paper, we propose a strategy called altruistic cooperation for cooperative multi-channel MAC protocols to conserve energy. The core idea is to introduce specialized nodes called altruists in the network whose only role is to acquire and share channel usage information. All other nodes, termed peers, go in to the sleep mode when idle. This strategy seems naive because it needs additional nodes to be deployed. In fact, it is unclear whether a desirable throughput-energy trade-off can be achieved and whether the cost of additional nodes can offset the performance gain. We perform a close study on this strategy in terms of three aspects: network deployment, cost efficiency, and system performance. Our study indicates that only a few additional nodes need to be deployed and cost efficiency is more than doubled in terms of a new metric called bit-price ratio that we propose. By using the strategy, a cooperative protocol is found to save up to 70% energy while not compromising throughput.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll50" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll50',50)">expand</a>

First, LEGO locally detects link failures by accurately monitoring the network condition and, upon detection of a failure, triggers network reconfiguration. Second, it dynamically forms/deforms a local group for cooperative network reconfiguration among local mesh routers in a fully-distributed manner. Next, LEGO intelligently generates a local network reconfiguration plan through which a thus-formed group recovers from local failures, while keeping network changes to minimum. Finally, by figuring local channel utilization and reconfiguration cost in its planning, LEGO maximizes the network's ability to meet diverse links' QoS demands. LEGO has been implemented on a Linux-based system and experimented on a reallife testbed, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering from link failures and its improvement of channel efficiency by up to 92%.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll51" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll51',51)">expand</a>

In this paper, we apply superposition coding to substantially improve network capacity of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Superposition coding is a physical layer technique that allows a transmitter to simultaneously send independent packets to multiple receivers. While superposition coding has been studied extensively by the physical layer community, we present the first design of practical and effective MAC protocols to take advantage of superposition coding in wireless mesh networks. Extensive evaluations show that superposition coding can be a practical method to increase the throughput of large, dense wireless mesh networks. Specifically, in a mesh network with 2 to 64 active receivers and one gateway, we show that our system can increase throughput up to 154%, with average gain ranging from 10% to 21%. When there are multiple gateways forming a mesh network, our system gains up to 98%, with average gain ranging from 24% to 46%. These results clearly demonstrate the potential benefits of our system. We also present results from an implementation of superposition coding using GNU Radio.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll52" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll52',52)">expand</a>

Emerging projects are leveraging the proliferation of private Wi-Fi networks to build a global-scale ubiquitous access infrastructure from autonomous, independently owned Internet connections at homes and other private properties. To ensure the trace ability and accountability required by the broadband ISPs and private owners of these Wi-Fi networks, reliable authentication and authorization are needed. This paper describes <i>authentication on the edge</i>, a localized and distributed authentication method for open Wi-Fi networks. Three main ideas are used to adapt to the variability and unreliability of these networks: the use of certificate-based authentication, the distribution of a segmented certificate revocation list to all entities and the self organization of access points into a social lookup network. These methods achieve the scalability needed for the overwhelming size and volume of a global network and increase resiliency against temporary failures in the infrastructure.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll53" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll53',53)">expand</a>

We envision that future usage of mobile devices and services will be highly personalized. Users will incorporate these new technologies into their daily lives, and the way they use new devices and services will reflect their personality and lifestyle. Therefore it is imperative to study and characterize the fundamental structure of wireless user behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and design efficient mobile networks and services. In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless users' behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network logs from two major university campuses. We represent the data using location-preference vectors, and utilize unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in user behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition techniques are used to identify (and differentiate between) major patterns. We discover multi-modal user behavior and hundreds of distinct groups with unique behavioral patterns in both campuses, and their sizes follow a power-law distribution. Our methods and findings might provide new directions in network management and behavior-aware network protocols and applications, to name a few.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll54" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll54',54)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide55" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless LANs are commonplace installations in enterprise environments. Their ease of use and deployment, however, are accompanied by a difficulty in their management and security. Proposed solutions to these problems are based on centralization; in the control plane through centralized authentication and allocation of channels and power levels, and in the data plane through time slotted medium access using centralized scheduling for interference mitigation. While centralization of some control plane tasks has been shown to be feasible, centralization on the data plane is significantly harder to realize. This is because it needs to take into account the inherent variability of the wireless medium while offering bounds on delay and jitter on the control paths. In this work, we present a study of the various problems that arise in centralization of the data plane in an enterprise WLAN. We believe that a pragmatic solution for data plane centralization is the key approachto provisioning an enterprise WLAN consisting of a dense deployment of APs.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll55" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll55',55)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide57" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we present a systematic experimental study of the effect of inter-cell interference on IEEE 802.11 performance. With increasing penetration of WiFi into residential areas and usage in ad hoc conference settings, chaotic unplanned deployments are becoming the norm rather than an exception. These networks often operate many nearby access points and stations on the same channel, either due to lack of coordination or insufficient available channels. Thus, inter-cell interference is common but not well-understood. According to conventional wisdom, the efficiency of an 802.11 network is determined by the number of active clients. Surprisingly, we find that with a typical TCP-dominant workload, cumulative system throughput is characterized by the number of interfering access points rather than the number of clients. We find that due to TCP flow control, the number of backlogged stations in such a network equals twice the number of access points. Thus, a single access point network proved very robust even with over one hundred clients. Multiple interfering access points, however, lead to an increase in collisions that reduces throughput and affects volume of traffic in the network.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll57" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll57',57)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide58" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Current rate selection algorithms are dominated by probe-based approaches that search for the best transmission rate using trial-and-error. When operating over a dynamic channel, probe-based techniques can perform poorly since they inefficiently search for the moving target presented by the constantly changing channel. We have developed a channel-aware rate adaptation algorithm - CHARM - that responds quickly to dynamic channel changes, and significantly outperforms probe-based algorithms in many instances. Unlike previous approaches, CHARM leverages channel reciprocity to obtain channel information without incurring RTS/CTS overhead. Our work shows that channel-aware rate selection is viable, and can significantly outperform probe-based rate adaptation over both static and dynamic channels.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll58" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll58',58)">expand</a>
