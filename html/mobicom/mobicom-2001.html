<span id="toHide1" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The ability to determine the orientation of a device is of fundamental importance in context aware and location-dependent mobile computing. By analogy to a traditional compass, knowledge of orientation through the <i>Cricket compass</i> attached to a mobile device enhances various applications, including efficient way-finding and navigation, directional service discovery, and “augmented-reality” displays. Our compass infrastructure enhances the spatial inference capability of the Cric ketindoor location system [20], and enables new pervasive computing applications.</p>
<p>Using fixed active beacons and carefully placed passive ultrasonic sensors, we show how to estimate the orientation of a mobile device to within a few degrees, using precise, sub-centimeter differences in distance estimates from a beacon to each sensor on the compass. Then, given a set of fixed, active position beacons whose locations are known, we describe an algorithm that combines several carrier arrival times to produce a robust estimate of the rigid orientation of the mobile compass.</p>
<p>The hardware of the Cricket compass is small enough to be integrated with a handheld mobile device. It includes five passive ultrasonic receivers, each 0.8cm in diameter, arrayed in a “V” shape a few centimeters across. Cricket beacons deployed throughout a building broadcast coupled 418MHz RF packet data and a 40KHz ultrasound carrier, which are processed by the compass software to obtain differential distance and position estimates. Our experimental results show that our prototype implementation can determine compass orientation to within 3 degrees when the true angle lies between ±30 degrees, and to within 5 degrees when the true angle lies between ±40 degrees, with respect to a fixed beacon.</p>

<span id="toHide2" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>With the increasing popularity of mobile computing devices, the need to access information in mobile environments has grown rapidly. Since the information has to be accessed over wireless networks, mobile information systems often have to deal with problems like low bandwidth, high delay, and frequent disconnections. Information hoarding is a method that tries to overcome these problems by transferring information, which the user will probably need, in advance. The hoarding mechanism that we describe in this paper exploits the location dependence of the information access, which is often found in mobile information systems. Our simulation results show that it is beneficial to do so and that we achieve higher hit ratios than with a caching mechanism.</p>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The bulk of proposed pervasive computing devices such as PDAs and cellular telephones operate as thin clients within a larger infrastructure. To access services within their local environment, these devices participate in a service discovery protocol which involves a master directory that registers all services available in the local environment. These directories typically are isolated from each other. Devices that move across service discovery domains have no access to information outside their current local domain. In this paper we propose an application-level protocol called VIA that enables data sharing among discovery domains. Each directory maintains a table of active links to other directories that share related information. A set of linked directories forms a data cluster that can be queried by devices for information. The data cluster is distributed, self-organizing, responsive to data mobility, and robust to failures. Using application-defined data schemas, clusters organize themselves into a hierarchy for efficient querying and network resource usage. Through analysis and simulation we describe the behavior of VIA under different workloads and show that the protocol overhead for both maintaining a cluster and handling failures grows slowly with the number of gateways.</p>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Existing on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms initiate route discovery only <i>after</i> a path breaks, incurring a significant cost in detecting the disconnection and establishing a new route. In this work, we investigate adding proactive route selection and maintenance to on-demand ad-hoc routing algorithms. More specifically, when a path is likely to be broken, a warning is sent to the source indicating the likelihood of a disconnection. The source can then initiate path discovery early, potentially avoiding the disconnection altogether. A path is considered likely to break when the received packet power becomes close to the minimum detectable power (other approaches are possible). Care must be taken to avoid initiating false route warnings due to fluctuations in received power caused by fading, multipath effects and similar random transient phenomena. Experiments demonstrate that adding proactive route selection and maintenance to DSR and AODV (on-demand ad hoc routing protocols) significantly reduces the number of broken paths, with a small increase in protocol overhead. Packet latency and jitter also goes down in most cases. We also show some experimental results obtained by running TCP on top of the proactive routing schemes proposed. Several improvements and extensions are also discussed. Pro-active route selection and maintenance is general and can be used with other routing algorithms and optimizations to them.</p>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>MERIT is a framework to assess routing protocols in mobile Ad hoc networks (manets). It is based on the novel concept of a <i>shortest mobile path</i> (SMP) in a <i>mobile qraph</i>, generalizing the traditional shortest path concept for the mobile environment. As a standard measure for routing protocols in a manet, the MERIT framework proposes the mean ratio of the cost of the actually used route to the cost of the optimal mobile path, under the same history of link metrics in the changing network topology. The MERIT <i>spectrum</i> takes the MERIT ratio as a function of parameters of interest yielding a multi-faceted representation of protocol effectiveness. This <i>Mean Real vs. Ideal cosT (MERIT)</i> framework is unifying in that it provides a measure that allows a protocol to be assessed independently of other protocols, within its own environment. We show that there is an efficient algorithm to solve the underlying SMP problem for important cases, making the approach practically feasible. We also investigate generalizations of and extensions within the MERIT framework.</p>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Early simulation experience with wireless ad hoc networks suggests that their capacity can be surprisingly low, due to the requirement that nodes forward each others' packets. The achievable capacity depends on network size, traffic patterns, and detailed local radio interactions. This paper examines these factors alone and in combination, using simulation and analysis from first principles. Our results include both specific constants and general scaling relationships helpful in understanding the limitations of wireless ad hoc networks.</p>
<p>We examine interactions of the 802.11 MAC and ad hoc forwarding and the effect on capacity for several simple configurations and traffic patterns. While 802.11 discovers reasonably good schedules, we nonetheless observe capacities markedly less than optimal for very simple chain and lattice networks with very regular traffic patterns. We validate some simulation results with experiments.</p>
<p>We also show that the traffic pattern determines whether an ad hoc network's per node capacity will scale to large networks. In particular, we show that for total capacity to scale up with network size the average distance between source and destination nodes must remain small as the network grows. Non-local traffic-patterns in which this average distance grows with the network size result in a rapid decrease of per node capacity. Thus the question “Are large ad hoc networks feasible?” reduces to a question about the likely locality of communication in such networks.</p>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We introduce a <i>geographical adaptive fidelity</i> (GAF) algorithm that reduces energy consumption in ad hoc wireless networks. GAF conserves energy by identifying nodes that are equivalent from a routing perspective and then turning off unnecessary nodes, keeping a constant level of routing <i>fidelity</i>. GAF moderates this policy using application- and system-level information; nodes that source or sink data remain on and intermediate nodes monitor and balance energy use. GAF is independent of the underlying ad hoc routing protocol; we simulate GAF over unmodified AODV and DSR. Analysis and simulation studies of GAF show that it can consume 40% to 60% less energy than an unmodified ad hoc routing protocol. Moreover, simulations of GAP suggest that network lifetime increases proportionally to node density; in one example, a four-fold increase in node density leads to network lifetime increase for 3 to 6 times (depending on the mobility pattern). More generally, GAF is an example of <i>adaptive fidelity</i>, a technique proposed for extending the lifetime of self-configuring systems by exploiting redundancy to conserve energy while maintaining application fidelity.</p>

<span id="toHide8" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents <i>Span</i>, a power saving technique for multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks that reduces energy consumption without significantly diminishing the capacity or connectivity of the network. Span builds on the observation that when a region of a shared-channel wireless network bag a sufficient density of nodes, only a small number of them need be on at any time to forward traffic for active connections.</p>
<p>Span is a distributed, randomized algorithm where nodes make local decisions on whether to sleep, or to join a <i>forwarding backbone</i> as a <i>coordinator</i>. Each node bases its decision on an estimate of how many of its neighbors will benefit from it being awake, and the amount of energy available to it. We give a randomized algorithm where coordinators rotate with time, demonstrating how localized node decisions lead to a connected, capacity-preserving global topology.</p>
<p>Improvement in system lifetime due to Span increases as the ratio of idle-to-sleep energy consumption increases, and increases as the density of the network increases. For example, our simulations show that with a practical energy model, system lifetime of an 802.11 network in power saving mode with Span is a factor of two better than without. Span integrates nicely with 802.11—when run in conjunction with the 802.11 power saving mode, Span improves communication latency, capacity, and system lifetime.</p>

We seek to optimize the lifetime of the network. We show that online power-aware routing does not have a constant competitive ratio to the off-line optimal algorithm. We develop an approximation algorithm called <i>max-min zP<subscrpt>min</subscrpt></i> that has a good empirical competitive ratio. To ensure scalability, we introduce a second online algorithm for power-aware routing. This hierarchical algorithm is called zone-based routing. Our experiments show that its performance is quite good.</p>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Digital appliances designed to simplify everyday tasks are readily available to end consumers. For example, mobile users can retrieve Web content using handheld devices since content retrieval is well-supported by infrastructure services such as transformational proxies. However, the same type of support is lacking for input-centric devices, those that create content and allow users to share content. This lack of infrastructural support makes input-centric devices hard to use and less useful.</p>
<p>The Appliance Data Services project seeks to explore a vision of an appliance computing world where users move data seamlessly among various devices. Based on this vision, we formulate three principles that guide the design of an architecture that helps realize this vision: bring devices to the forefront, minimize the number of device features, and place functionality in the network infrastructure. We evaluate our implementation of the ADS architecture based on these principles, and build applications using the ADS framework to evaluate the ease with which appliance computing applications can be built using the framework. We find that it is relatively simple to build and extend applications on ADS that make using digital devices easier, which results in the devices themselves becoming more useful.</p>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper we describe the Mobile Link (m-Links) infrastructure for utilizing existing World Wide Web content and services on wireless phones and other very small Internet terminals. Very small devices, typically with 3-20 lines of text, provide portability and other functionality while sacrificing usability as Internet terminals. In order to provide access on such limited hardware we propose a small device web navigation model that is more appropriate than the desktop computer's web browsing model. We introduce a middleware proxy, the Navigation Engine, to facilitate the navigation model by concisely displaying the Web's link (i.e., URL) structure. Because not all Web information is appropriately “linked,” the Navigation Engine incorporates data-detectors to extract bits of useful information such as phone numbers and addresses. In order to maximize program-data composibility, multiple network-based services (similar to browser plug-ins) are keyed to a link's attributes such as its MIME type. We have built this system with an emphasis on user extensibility and we describe the design and implementation as well as a basic set of middleware services that we have found to be particularly important.</p>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Despite enormous progress in networking and computing technologies, their application has remained restricted to conventional person-to-person and person-to-computer communication. However, continual reduction in cost and form factor is now making it possible to imbed networking - even wireless networking - and computing capabilities not just in our PCs and laptops but also other objects. Further, a marriage of these ever tinier and cheaper processors and wireless network interfaces with emerging micro-sensors based on MEMS technology is allowing cheap sensing, processing, and communication capabilities to be unobtrusively embedded in familiar physical objects. The result is an emerging paradigm shift where the primary role of information technology would be to enhance or assist in "person to physical world communication via familiar physical objects with embedded (a) micro-sensors to react to external stimuli, and (b) wireless networking and computing engines for tetherless communication with compute servers and other networked embedded objects. In this paper we present the application of sensor-based wireless networks to a "Smart Kindergarten that we are developing to target developmental problem-solving environments for early childhood education. This is a natural application as young children learn by exploring and interacting with objects such as toys in their environment. Our envisioned system would enhance the education process by providing a childhood learning environment that is individualized to each child, adapts to the context, coordinates activities of multiple children, and allows continual unobtrusive evaluation of the learning process by the teacher. This would be done by wirelessly-networked, sensor-enhanced toys and other classroom objects with back-end middleware services and database techniques. We explore wireless networking, middleware, and data management technologies for realizing this application, and describe challenges arising from ad hoc distributed structure, unreliable sensing, large scale/density, and novel sensor data types that are characteristic of such deeply instrumented environments with inter-networked physical objects.</p>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks will provide one of the missing connections between the Internet and the physical world. One of the fundamental problems in sensor networks is the calculation of coverage. Exposure is directly related to coverage in that it is a measure of how well an object, moving on an arbitrary path, can be observed by the sensor network over a period of time.</p>
<p>In addition to the informal definition, we formally define exposure and study its properties. We have developed an efficient and effective algorithm for exposure calculation in sensor networks, specifically for finding minimal exposure paths. The minimal exposure path provides valuable information about the worst case exposure-based coverage in sensor networks. The algorithm works for any given distribution of sensors, sensor and intensity models, and characteristics of the network. It provides an unbounded level of accuracy as a function of run time and storage. We provide an extensive collection of experimental results and study the scaling behavior of exposure and the proposed algorithm for its calculation.</p>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Implanted biomedical devices have the potential to revolutionize medicine. <i>Smart sensors</i>, which are created by combining sensing materials with integrated circuitry, are being considered for several biomedical applications such as a glucose level monitor or a retina prosthesis. These devices require the capability to communicate with an external computer system (base station) via a wireless interface. The limited power and computational capabilities of smart sensor based biological implants present research challenges in several aspects of wireless networking due to the need for having a bio-compatible, fault-tolerant, energy-efficient, and scalable design. Further, em bedding thesesensors in humans add additional requirements. For example, the wireless networking solutions should be ultra-safe and reliable, work trouble-free in different geographical locations (although implants are typically not expected to move; they shouldn't restrict the movements of their human host), and require minimal maintenance. This necessitates application-specific solutions which are vastly different from traditional solutions.</p>
<p>In this paper, we describe the potential of biomedical smart sensors. We then explain the challenges for wireless networking of human-embedded smart sensor arrays and our preliminary approach for wireless networking of a retina prosthesis. Our aim is to motivate vigorous research in this area by illustrating the need for more application-specific and novel approaches toward developing wireless networking solutions for human-implanted smart sensors.</p>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The recent advances in radio and em beddedsystem technologies have enabled the proliferation of wireless microsensor networks. Such wirelessly connected sensors are released in many diverse environments to perform various monitoring tasks. In many such tasks, location awareness is inherently one of the most essential system parameters. It is not only needed to report the origins of events, but also to assist group querying of sensors, routing, and to answer questions on the network coverage. In this paper we present a novel approach to the localization of sensors in an ad-hoc network. We describe a system called AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System) that enables sensor nodes to discover their locations using a set distributed iterative algorithms. The operation of AHLoS is demonstrated with an accuracy of a few centimeters using our prototype testbed while scalability and performance are studied through simulation.</p>

<p>We present a suite of security building blocks optimized for resource-constrained environments and wireless communication. SPINS has two secure building blocks: SNEP and &amp;mgr;TESLA SNEP provides the following important baseline security primitives: Data confidentiality, two-party data authentication, and data freshness. A particularly hard problem is to provide efficient broadcast authentication, which is an important mechanism for sensor networks. &amp;mgr;TESLA is a new protocol which provides authenticated broadcast for severely resource-constrained environments. We implemented the above protocols, and show that they are practical even on minimal hardware: the performance of the protocol suite easily matches the data rate of our network. Additionally, we demonstrate that the suite can be used for building higher level protocols.</p>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Providing quality of service in random access multi-hop wireless networks requires support from both medium access and packet scheduling algorithms. However, due to the distributed nature of ad hoc networks, nodes may not be able to determine the next packet that would be transmitted in a (hypothetical) centralized and ideal dynamic priority scheduler. In this paper, we develop two mechanisms for QoS communication in multi-hop wireless networks. First, we devise <i>distributed priority scheduling</i> a technique that piggybacks the priority tag of a node's head-of-line packet onto handshake and data packets; <i>e.g.</i>, RTS/DATA packets in IEEE 802.11. By monitoring transmitted packets, each node maintains a scheduling table which is used to assess the node's priority level relative to other nodes. We then incorporate this scheduling table into existing IEEE 802.11 priority back-off schemes to approximate the idealized schedule. Second, we observe that congestion, link errors, and the random nature of medium access prohibit an exact realization of the ideal schedule. Consequently, we devise a scheduling scheme termed<i>multi-hop coordination</i>so that downstream nodes can increase a packet's relative priority to make up for excessive delays incurred upstream. We next develop a simple analytical model to quantitatively explore these two mechanisms. In the former case, we study the impact of the probability of overhearing another packet's priority index on the scheme's ability to achieve the ideal schedule. In the latter case, we explore the role of multi-hop coordination in increasing the probability that a packet satisfies its end-to-end QoS target. Finally, we perform a set of ns-2 simulations to study the scheme's performance under more realistic conditions.</p>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless local area networks (W-LANs) have become increasingly popular due to the recent availability of affordable devices that are capable of communicating at high data rates. These high rates are possible, in part, through new modulation schemes that are optimized for the channel conditions bringing about a dramatic increase in bandwidth efficiency. Since the choice of which modulation scheme to use depends on the current state of the transmission channel, newer wireless devices often support multiple modulation schemes, and hence multiple datarates, with mechanisms to switch between them Users are given the option to either select an operational datarate manually or to let the device automatically choose the appropriate modulation scheme (data rate) to match the prevailing conditions. Automatic rate selection protocols have been studied for cellular networks but there have been relatively few proposals for W-LANs. In this paper we present a rate adaptive MAC protocol called the Receiver-Based AutoRate (RBAR) protocol. The novelty of RBAR is that its rate adaptation mechanism is in the receiver instead of in the sender. This is in contrast to existing schemes in devices like the WaveLAN II [15]. We show that RBAR is better because it results in a more efficient channel quality estimation which is then reflected in a higher overall throughput Our protocol is based on the RTS/CTS mechanism and consequently it can be incorporated into many medium access control protocols including the widely popular IEEE 802.11 protocol. Simulation results of an implementation of RBAR inside IEEE 802.11 show that RBAR performs consistently well.</p>

<span id="toHide22" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Power consumption is the limiting factor for the functionality of future wearable devices. Since interactive applications like wireless information access generate bursts of activities, it is important to match the performance of the wearable device accordingly. This paper describes a system with a microprocessor whose speed can be varied (frequency scaling) as well as its supply voltage. Voltage scaling is important for reducing power consumption to very low values when operating at low speeds. Measurements show that the energy per instruction at minimal speed is 1/5 of the energy required at full speed. The frequency and voltage can be scaled dynamically from user space in only 140 &amp;mgr;s. This allows power-aware applications to quickly adjust the performance level of the processor whenever the workload changes. Experiments with an H.263 video benchmark show that the power-aware decoder outperforms a static fixed-frequency policy as well as a dynamic interval-based scheduler.</p>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The potential for collaborative, robust networks of microsensors has attracted a great deal of research attention. For the most part, this is due to the compelling applications that will be enabled once wireless microsensor networks are in place; location-sensing, environmental sensing, medical monitoring and similar applications are all gaining interest. However, wireless microsensor networks pose numerous design challenges. For applications requiring long-term, robust sensing, such as military reconnaissance, one important challenge is to design sensor networks that have long system lifetimes. This challenge is especially difficult due to the energy-constrained nature of the devices. In order to design networks that have extremely long lifetimes, we propose a physical layer driven approach to designing protocols and algorithms. We first present a hardware model for our wireless sensor node and then introduce the design of physical layer aware protocols, algorithms, and applications that minimize energy consumption of the system. Our approach prescribes methods that can be used at all levels of the hierarchy to take advantage of the underlying hardware. We also show how to reduce energy consumption of non-ideal hardware through physical layer aware algorithms and protocols.</p>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>TCP Westwood (TCPW) is a sender-side modification of the TCP congestion window algorithm that improves upon the performance of TCP Reno in wired as well as wireless networks. The improvement is most significant in wireless networks with lossy links, since TCP Westwood relies on end-to-end bandwidth estimation to discriminate the cause of packet loss (congestion or wireless channel effect) which is a major problem in TCP Reno. An important distinguishing feature of TCP Westwood with respect to previous wireless TCP “extensions” is that it does not require inspection and/or interception of TCP packets at intermediate (proxy) nodes. Rather, it fully complies with the end-to-end TCP design principle. The key innovative idea is to continuously measure at the TCP source the rate of the connection by monitoring the rate of returning ACKs. The estimate is then used to compute congestion window and slow start threshold after a congestion episode, that is, after three duplicate acknowledgments or after a timeout. The rationale of this strategy is simple: in contrast with TCP Reno, which “blindly” halves the congestion window after three duplicate ACKs, TCP Westwood attempts to select a slow start threshold and a congestion window which are consistent with the effective bandwidth used at the time congestion is experienced. We call this mechanism <i>faster recovery</i>. The proposed mechanism is particularly effective over wireless links where sporadic losses due to radio channel problems are often misinterpreted as a symptom of congestion by current TCP schemes and thus lead to an unnecessary window reduction. Experimental studies reveal improvements in throughput performance, as well as in fairness. In addition, friendliness with TCP Reno was observed in a set of experiments showing that TCP Reno connections are not starved by TCPW connections. Most importantly, TCPW is extremely effective in mixed wired and wireless networks where throughput improvements of up to 550% are observed. Finally, TCPW performs almost as well as localized link layer approaches such as the popular Snoop scheme, without incurring the O/H of a specialized link layer protocol.</p>

<span id="toHide26" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile systems must adapt their behavior to changing network conditions. To do this, they must accurately estimate available network capacity. Producing quality estimates is challenging because network observations are noisy, particularly in mobile, ad hoc networks. Current systems depend on simple, exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. These filters are either able to detect true changes quickly or to mask observed noise and transients, but cannot do both. In this paper, we present four filters designed to react quickly to persistent changes while tolerating transient noise. Such filters are <i>agile</i> when possible, but <i>stable</i> when necessary, adapting their behavior to prevailing conditions. These filters are evaluated in a variety of networking situations, including persistent and transient change, congestion, and topology changes. We find that one filter, based on techniques from <i>statistical process control</i> provides performance superior to the other three. Compared to two EWMA filters, one agile and the other stable, it is able to offer the agility of the former in four of five scenarios and the stability of the latter in three of four scenarios.</p>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>On the verge of realizing truly ubiquitous access to high quality data (e.g., media, financial, etc.), an efficient <i>burst admission control</i> algorithm is crucial in third generation (3G) wireless communication systems based on wideband CDMA standards. In this paper, we propose and analyze the performance of a novel burst admission technique, called the <i>multiple- burst admission-spatial dimension</i> algorithm (MBA-SD) to judiciously allocate the precious channels in wideband CDMA systems to burst requests. The major contributions of the present paper are the novel formulation of the problem as an integer programming problem and the derivation of an optimal algorithm for scheduling the burst requests. Both the forward link and the reverse link burst requests are considered and the system is simulated by dynamic simulations which takes into account of the user mobility, power control, and soft hand-off. We found that significant performance improvement, in terms of data user capacity coverage, and admission and outage probabilities, could be achieved by our scheme compared to the existing burst assignment algorithms.</p>

<span id="toHide28" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We describe the protocols implemented in the Ricochet MCDN system to provide continuous connectivity to mobile users traveling up to 70 mph. These protocols are general in nature for any frequency-hopping microcell-based system, particularly those that follow the FCC part 15.247 rules [9] and operate in unlicensed spectrum. We also present throughput measurements as a function of velocity and describe a model to predict those numbers based upon the protocols implemented. The MCDN system is a mesh-based system of microcells that are connected wirelessly to an interspersed mesh of wired access points (WAPs) that cover approximately 12 square miles on average [7]. The average microcell density is approximately 5-6 per square mile, with 3-8 overlapping cells at each point. Since the system is entirely packet-based, we have instantaneous hand-off between microcells as there are no complicated cellular-type negotiations for circuits required as all of the information needed to route the packet through the system is included in the header; however, when traveling through the mesh of microcells at a high rate of speed, the mobile unit must acquire new microcells fast enough to ensure continuous connectivity. The system must also know how to route packets to the mobile unit as it drops old cells and acquires new ones, as well as being able to contact a moving mobile unit. This paper discusses the acquisition, registration, and routing protocols that make this possible and reviews performance data of typical mobile users.</p>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In wireless networks, mobile hosts must update the network with their current location in order to get packets delivered. Paging facilitates efficient power management at the mobile host by allowing the host to update the networkless frequently at the cost of providing the network with only approximate location information. The network determines the exact location of a mobile host through paging before delivering packets destined to the mobile host. In this paper, we propose the concept of paging as an IP service. IP paging enables a common infrastructure and protocol to support the different wireless interfaces such as CDMA, GPRS, wireless LAN, avoiding the duplication of several application layer paging implementations and the inter-operability issues that exists today. We present the design, implementation, and detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation, using measurements and simulation, of three IP-based paging protocols for mobile hosts.</p>

<span id="toHide30" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>An efficient signaling protocol for mobility application part (MAP) is essential to mobility support when mobile terminals roam between different networks in next generation wireless systems such as IMT-2000. In this paper, a new signaling protocol is proposed to reduce the overhead caused by mobility management, alleviating network load and consumption of network resources. Moreover, the new protocol effectively reduces the latency of call delivery and call loss rate due to crossing wireless systems with different standards and signaling protocols. Instead of performing location registration after a mobile user arrives at the new system, the mobile user is required to update its location information prior to its reaching the boundary of two systems. Results in this study demonstrate that the new protocol yields significant benefits in terms of reducing signaling costs, delays, and call loss rates.</p>
