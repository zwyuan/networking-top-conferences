<span id="toHide2" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We present a framework for monitoring enterprise wireless networks using desktop infrastructure. The framework is called DAIR, which is short for <i>Dense Array of Inexpensive Radios</i>. We demonstrate that the DAIR framework is useful for detecting rogue wireless devices (e.g., access points) attached to corporate networks, as well as for detecting Denial of Service attacks on Wi-Fi networks.Prior proposals in this area include monitoring the network via a combination of access points (APs), mobile clients, and dedicated sensor nodes. We show that a dense deployment of sensors is necessary to effectively monitor Wi-Fi networks for certain types of threats, and one can not accomplish this using access points alone. An ordinary, single-radio AP can not monitor multiple channels effectively, without adversely impacting the associated clients. Moreover, we show that a typical deployment of access points is not sufficiently dense to detect the presence of rogue wireless devices. Due to power constraints, mobile devices can provide only limited assistance in monitoring wireless networks. Deploying a dense array of dedicated sensor nodes is an expensive proposition.Our solution is based on two simple observations. First, in most enterprise environments, one finds plenty of desktop machines with good wired connectivity, and spare CPU and disk resources. Second, inexpensive USB-based wireless adapters are commonly available. By attaching these adapters to desktop machines, and dedicating the adapters to the task of monitoring the wireless network, we create a low cost management infrastructure.</div></span> <a id="expcoll2" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll2',2)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The majority of security schemes available for sensor networks assume deployment in areas without access to a wired infrastructure. More specifically, nodes in these networks are unable to leverage key distribution centers (KDCs) to assist them with key management. In networks with a heterogeneous mix of nodes, however, it is not unrealistic to assume that some more powerful nodes have at least intermittent contact with a backbone network. For instance, an air-deployed battlefield network may have to operate securely for some time until uplinked friendly forces move through the area. We therefore propose LIGER, a hybrid key management scheme for heterogeneous sensor networks that allows systems to operate in both the presence and absence of a KDC. Specifically, when no KDC is available, nodes communicate securely with each other based upon a probabilistic unbalanced method of key management. The ability to access a KDC allows nodes to probabilistically authenticate neighboring devices with which they are communicating. We also demonstrate that this scheme is robust to the compromise of both low and high capability nodes and that the same keys can be used for both modes of operation. Detailed experiments and simulations are used to show that LIGER is a highly practical solution for the current generation of sensors and the unbalanced approach can significantly reduce network initialization time.</div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper we present FireWxNet, a multi-tiered portable wireless system for monitoring weather conditions in rugged wildland fire environments. FireWxNet provides the fire fighting community the ability to safely and easily measure and view fire and weather conditions over a wide range of locations and elevations within forest fires. This previously unattainable information allows fire behavior analysts to better predict fire behavior, heightening safety considerations. Our system uses a tiered structure beginning with directional radios to stretch deployment capabilities into the wilderness far beyond current infrastructures. At the end point of our system we designed and integrated a multi-hop sensor network to provide environmental data. We also integrated web-enabled surveillance cameras to provide visual data. This paper describes a week long full system deployment utilizing 3 sensor networks and 2 web-cams in the Selway-Salmon Complex Fires of 2005. We perform an analysis of system performance and present observations and lessons gained from our deployment.</div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Automatic adaptation of content for mobile devices is a challenging problem because optimal adaptation often depends on the usage semantics of content, as well as the context of users (e.g., screen size of device being used, network connectivity, location, etc.). Usage-awaRe Interactive Content Adaptation (URICA) is an automatic technique that adapts content for mobile devices based on usage semantics. URICA allows a user who is unsatisfied with the system's current adaptation prediction to take control of the adaptation process and make changes until the content is suitably adapted for her purposes. The adaptation system learns from the user's modifications and adjusts its prediction for future accesses by other users. This paper shows that it is possible to exploit user interaction to learn how to adapt content based on context. We introduce Feedback-driven Context Selection (FCS), an automatic technique that leverages user interaction to identify the context that has the most impact on adaptation requirements. We added context-awareness to URICA so that it makes adaptation predictions for a user based only on the history of the community of users that share the context identified by FCS. The result is an automatic adaptation system that provides fine grain adaptations that reflect both the user's context and the content's usage semantics. This level of fine grain adaptation was previously available only in content that was customized manually. Experiments with two context-aware URICA prototypes show that FCS correctly identifies the contextual characteristics that impact adaptation requirements, and that grouping users into communities based on context improves the performance of the adaptation system by up to 79%.</div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We introduce a novel infrastructure supporting automatic updates for dynamic content browsing on resource constrained mobile devices. Currently, the client is forced to continuously poll for updates from potentially different data sources, such as, e-commerce, on-line auctions, stock and weather sites, to stay up to date with potential changes in content. We employ a pair of proxies, located on the mobile client and on a fully-connected edge server, respectively, to minimize the battery consumption caused by wireless data transfers to and from the mobile device. The client specifies her interest in changes to specific parts of pages by highlighting portions of already loaded web pages in her browser. The edge proxy polls the web servers involved, and if relevant changes have occurred, it aggregates the updates as one batch to be sent to the client. The proxy running on the mobile device can pull these updates from the edge proxy, either on-demand or periodically, or can listen for "pushed" updates initiated by the edge proxy. We also use SMS messages to indicate available updates and inform the user of which pages have changed. Our approach is fully implemented using two alternative wireless networking technologies, 802.11 and GPRS, and evaluated on real world dynamic content traces. Our evaluation explores the data transfer savings enabled by our proxy-based infrastructure and the energy consumption when using each of the two networking capabilities. Our results show that our proxy system saves data transfers to and from the mobile device by an order of magnitude and battery consumption by up to a factor of 4.5, compared to the client-initiated continuous polling approach. Our results also show even in the case where users never visit the same page twice, energy consumption is reduced by the pre-fetching and batching or our proxy system.</div></span> <a id="expcoll7" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll7',7)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">There is a fair amount of evidence that mesh (static multihop wireless) networks are gaining popularity, both in the academic literature and in the commercial space. Nonetheless, none of the prior work has evaluated the feasibility of applications on mesh through the use of deployed networks and real user traffic. The state of the art is the use of deployed testbeds with synthetic traces consisting of random traffic patterns.In this paper, we evaluate the feasibility of a mesh network for an all-wireless office using traces of office users and an actual 21-node multi-radio mesh testbed in an office area. Unlike previous mesh studies that have examined routing design in detail, we examine how different office mesh design choices impact the performance of user traffic. From our traces of 11 users spanning over a month, we identify 3 one hour trace periods with different characteristics and evaluate network performance for them. In addition, we consider different user-server placement, different wireless hardware, different wireless settings and different routing metrics.We find that our captured traffic is significantly different from the synthetic workloads typically used in the prior work. Our trace capture and replay methodology allows us to directly quantify the feasibility of office meshes by measuring the additional delay experienced by individual transactions made by user applications. Performance on our mesh network depends on the routing metric chosen, the user-server placement and the traffic load period. The choice of wireless hardware and wireless settings has a significant impact on performance under heavy load and challenging placement. Ultimately we conclude that for our traces and deployed system, under most conditions, <i>all-wireless office meshes are feasible</i>. In most cases, individual transactions incur under 20ms of additional delay over the mesh network. We believe this is an acceptable delay for most applications where a wired network to every machine is not readily available. We argue that our results are scalable to a network of over 100 users.</div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

In SMesh, the entire mesh network is seen by the mobile clients as a single, omnipresent access point.Fast handoff is achieved by ensuring that each client is served by at least one access point at any time. Mobile clients are handled by a single access point during stable connectivity times. During handoff transitions, SMesh uses more than one access point to handle the moving client. Access points continuously monitor the connectivity quality of any client in their range and efficiently share this information with other access points in the vicinity of that client to coordinate which of them should serve the client.Experimental results on a fully deployed mesh network consisting of 14 access points demonstrate the effectiveness of the SMesh architecture and its handoff protocol.</div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Multihop wireless mesh networks can provide Internet access over a wide area with minimal infrastructure expenditure. In this work, we present a measurement driven deployment strategy and a data-driven model to study the impact of design and topology decisions on network-wide performance and cost. We perform extensive measurements in a two-tier urban scenario to characterize the propagation environment and correlate received signal strength with application layer throughput. We find that well-known estimates for pathloss produce either heavily overprovisioned networks resulting in an order of magnitude increase in cost for high pathloss estimates or completely disconnected networks for low pathloss estimates. Modeling throughput with wireless interface manufacturer specifications similarly results in severely underprovisioned networks. Further, we measure competing, multihop flow traffic matrices to empirically define achievable throughputs of fully backlogged, rate limited, and web-emulated traffic. We find that while fully backlogged flows produce starving nodes, rate-controlling flows to a fixed value yields fairness and high aggregate throughput. Likewise, transmission gaps occurring in statistically multiplexed web traffic, even under high offered load, remove starvation and yield high performance. In comparison, we find that well-known noncompeting flow models for mesh networks over-estimate network-wide throughput by a factor of 2. Finally, our placement study shows that a regular grid topology achieves up to 50 percent greater throughput than random node placement.</div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

A general software architecture is needed to support different categories of such monitoring services.

SATIRE records the owner's activity and location for subsequent automated uploading and archiving. The personal archive can later be searched for particular events to answer questions regarding past and present user activity, location, and behavior patterns.

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Limited fidelity of software-based wireless network simulations has prompted many researchers to build testbeds for developing and evaluating their wireless protocols and mobile applications. Since most testbeds are tailored to the needs of specific research projects, they cannot be easily reused for other research projects that may have different requirements on physical topology, radio channel characteristics or mobility pattern. In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of MiNT-m, an experimentation platform devised specifically to support arbitrary experiments for mobile multi-hop wireless network protocols. In addition to inheriting the miniaturization feature from its predecessor MiNT [9], MiNT-m enables flexible testbed reconfiguration on an experiment-by-experiment basis by putting each testbed node on a centrally controlled untethered mobile robot. To support mobility and reconfiguration of testbed nodes, MiNT-m includes a scalable mobile robot navigation control subsystem, which in turn consists of a vision-based robot positioning module and a collision avoidance-based trajectory planning module. Further, MiNT-m provides a comprehensive network/experiment management subsystem that affords a user full interactive control over the testbed as well as real-time visualization of the testbed activities. Finally, because MiNT-m is designed to be a shared research infrastructure that supports 24x7 operation, it incorporates a novel automatic battery recharging capability that enables testbed robots to operate without human intervention for weeks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide17" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Location determination of mobile users within a building has attracted much attention lately due to its many applications in mobile networking including network intrusion detection problems. However, it is challenging due to the complexities of the indoor radio propagation characteristics exacerbated by the mobility of the user. A common practice is to mechanically generate a table showing the radio signal strength at different known locations in the building. A mobile user's location at an arbitrary point in the building is determined by measuring the signal strength at the location in question and determining the location by referring to the above table using a LMSE (least mean square error) criterion. Obviously, this is a very tedious and time consuming task. This paper proposes a novel and automated location determination method called ARIADNE. Using a two dimensional construction floor plan and only a single actual signal strength measurement, ARIADNE generates an estimated signal strength map comparable to those generated manually by actual measurements. Given the signal measurements for a mobile, a proposed clustering algorithm searches that signal strength map to determine the current mobile's location. The results from ARIADNE are comparable and may even be superior to those from existing localization schemes.</div></span> <a id="expcoll17" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll17',17)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation of the PinPoint location determination system. PinPoint is a distributed algorithm that enables a set of $n$ nodes to determine the RF propagation delays between every pair of nodes, from which the inter-node distances and hence the spatial topology can be readily determined. PinPoint does not require any calibration of the area of interest and thus is rapidly deployable. Unlike existing time-of-arrival techniques, PinPoint does not require an infrastructure of accurate clocks (e.g., GPS) nor does it incur the <i>o</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) message exchanges of "echoing" techniques. PinPoint can work with nodes having inexpensive crystal oscillator clocks, and incurs a <b><i>constant</i></b> number of message exchanges per node to determine the location of $n$ nodes. Each node's clock is assumed to run reliably but asynchronously with respect to the other nodes, i.e., they can run at slightly different rates because of hardware (oscillator) inaccuracies. PinPoint provides a mathematical way to compensate for these clock differences in order to arrive at a very precise timestamp recovery that in turn leads to a precise distance determination. Moreover, each node is able to determine the clock characteristics of other nodes in its neighborhood allowing network synchronization. We present a prototype implementation for PinPoint and discusses the practical issues in implementing the mathematical framework and how PinPoint handles the different sources of error affecting its accuracy. Evaluation of the prototype in typical indoor and outdoor environments shows that PinPoint gives an average accuracy of four to six feet, in different environments, allowing PinPoint to support accurate rapidly deployable localization scenarios.</div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

With the goal of realism, this framework combines coarse-grained wireless traces, i.e., association data between WiFi users and access points, with an actual map of the space over which the traces were collected. Through a sequence of data processing steps, including filtering the data trace and converting the map to a graph representation, this framework generates a probabilistic mobility model that produces user movement patterns that are representative of real movement. This is done by adopting a set of heuristics that help us infer the paths users take between access points.

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Deployments of wireless LANs consisting of hundreds of 802.11 access points with a large number of users have been reported in enterprises as well as college campuses. However, due to the unreliable nature of wireless links, users frequently encounter degraded performance and lack of coverage. This problem is even worse in unplanned networks, such as the numerous access points deployed by homeowners. Existing approaches that aim to diagnose these problems are inefficient because they troubleshoot at too high a level, and are unable to distinguish among the root causes of degradation. This paper designs, implements, and tests fine-grained detection algorithms that are capable of distinguishing between root causes of wireless anomalies at the depth of the physical layer. An important property that emerges from our system is that diagnostic observations are combined from multiple sources over multiple time instances for improved accuracy and efficiency.</div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide22" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">While 802.11-based wireless hotspots are proliferating, users often have little recourse when the network does not work or performs poorly <i>for them</i>. They are left trying to manually debug the problem, which can be a frustrating and disruptive process. The users' troubles are compounded by the absence of network administrators or an IT department to turn to in many 802.11 hotspot settings (e.g., cafes, airports, conferences).We present WiFiProfiler, a system in which wireless hosts cooperate to diagnose and possibly resolve network problems in an automated manner, without requiring any infrastructural support. The key observation is that even if a host's wireless link to an access point is not working, the host is often within the range of other wireless nodes and is in a position to communicate with them (a little) peer-to-peer. We leverage this ability to create a shared information plane, which enables wireless hosts to exchange a range of information about their network settings and the health of their network connectivity. By aggregating and correlating such information across multiple wireless hosts, we infer the likely cause of the problem. Our implementation on Windows XP shows that WiFiProfiler is effective in diagnosing a range of problems and imposes a low overhead on the participating hosts.</div></span> <a id="expcoll22" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll22',22)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">CoolSpots enable a wireless mobile device to automatically switch between multiple radio interfaces, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, in order to increase battery lifetime. The main contribution of this work is an exploration of the policies that enable a system to switch among these interfaces, each with diverse radio characteristics and different ranges, in order to save power - supported by detailed quantitative measurements. The system and policies do not require any changes to the mobile applications themselves, and changes required to existing infrastructure are minimal. Results are reported for a suite of commonly used applications, such as file transfer, web browsing, and streaming media, across a range of operating conditions. Experimental validation of the CoolSpot system on a mobile research platform shows substantial energy savings: more than a 50% reduction in energy consumption of the wireless subsystem is possible, with an associated increase in the effective battery lifetime.</div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">This paper presents Virgil, an automatic access point discovery and selection system. Unlike existing systems that select access points based entirely on received signal strength, Virgil scans for all available APs at a location, quickly associates to each, and runs a battery of tests to estimate the quality of each AP's connection to the Internet. Virgil also probes for blocked or redirected ports, to guide AP selection in favor of preserving application services that are currently in use. Results of our evaluation across five neighborhoods in three cities show Virgil finds a usable connection from 22% to 100% more often than selecting based on signal strength alone. By caching AP test results, Virgil both improves performance and success rate. Our overhead is acceptable and is shown to be faster than manually selecting an AP with Windows XP.</div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide26" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The handoff algorithms in the current generation of 802.11 networks are primarily reactive in nature, because they wait until the link quality degrades substantially to trigger a handoff. They further rely on instantaneous signal strength measurements when choosing the best AP. This approach leads to handoff delays on the order of 1-2 seconds that are unacceptable for delay sensitive applications such as VoIP. We propose a fundamentally new approach to handoffs that is based on <i>continuous monitoring</i> of wireless links. In our approach, a client measures the beacon strengths of all the APs operating on the current, and the overlapping channels, and makes its handoff decisions based on the long-term, and short-term trends in these signals. We show through experiments in a campus wireless network that our proposed algorithms result in more than 50% reduction in average handoff delays, while having the potential to improve overall user performance. Our algorithms have been implemented in today's hardware, and unlike other proposed roaming algorithms in the literature, need no infrastructure support.</div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>
