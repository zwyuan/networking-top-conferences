Therefore, a theory of mobile devices would focus on compact devices that support human relationships, provide salient information, and enable creative expression. The foundations are not only the megahertz of connectivity, but also the usability and universality of interfaces. Demonstrations include digital photo applications, personal info, healthcare, and e-commerce.</div></span> <a id="expcoll1" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll1',1)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Computation off-loading, i.e., remote execution, has been shown to be effective for extending the computational power and battery life of resource-restricted devices, e.g., hand-held, wearable, and pervasive computers. Remote execution systems must predict the cost of executing both locally and remotely to determine when off-loading will be most beneficial. These costs however, are dependent upon the execution behavior of the task being considered and the highly-variable performance of the underlying resources, e.g., CPU (local and remote), bandwidth, and network latency. As such, remote execution systems must employ sophisticated, prediction techniques that accurately guide computation off-loading. Moreover, these techniques must be efficient, i.e., they cannot consume significant resources, e.g., energy, execution time, etc., since they are performed on the mobile device.In this paper, we present NWSLite, a computationally efficient, highly accurate prediction utility for mobile devices. NWSLite is an extension to the Network Weather Service (NWS), a dynamic forecasting toolkit for adaptive scheduling of high-performance Computational Grid applications. We significantly scaled down the NWS to reduce its resource consumption yet still achieve accuracy that exceeds that of extant remote execution prediction methods. We empirically analyze and compare both the prediction accuracy and the cost of NWSLite and a number of different forecasting methods from existing remote execution systems. We evaluate the efficacy of the different methods using a wide range of mobile applications and resources.</div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Energy management has become one of the great challenges in portable computing. This is the result of the increasing energy requirements of modern portable devices without a corresponding increase in battery technology. <i>uSleep</i> is an energy reduction technique for handheld devices that is most effective when the handheld's processor is lightly loaded, such as when the user is reading a document or looking at a web page. When possible, rather than using the processor's idle mode, uSleep tries to put the processor in sleep mode for short periods (less than one second) without affecting the user's experience. To enhance the perception that the system is on, an image is maintained on the display and activity is resumed as a result of external events such as touch-screen and button activity. We have implemented, analyzed and evaluated uSleep on a prototype pocket computer, where it has reduced energy consumption by up to 60%.</div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide6" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We observe that the modularity of current power management algorithms often leads to poor results. We propose two new interfaces that pierce the abstraction barrier that inhibits device power management. First, an OS power manager allows applications to query the current power mode of I/O devices to evaluate the performance and energy cost of alternative strategies for reading and writing data. Second, we allow applications to disclose <i>ghost hints</i> that enable better power management in the presence of multiple devices. Adaptive applications issue ghost hints to device power managers when they are forced to use a poor I/O path because a device is not in an ideal power mode; such hints allow devices to implement proactive power management strategies that do not depend upon passive load observation. Using these new interfaces, we implement a middleware layer that supports adaptive disk cache management. On an iPAQ handheld running Linux, our cache manager reduces interactive response time for a Web browser by 27% and decreases total energy usage by 9%. For a mail reader, the cache manager decreases response time by 42% and energy use by 5%.</div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

Effective management of media content is not possible without content-related metadata. In this paper we describe a content metadata creation process for images taken with a mobile phone. The design goals were to automate the creation of image content metadata by leveraging automatically available contextual metadata on the mobile phone, to use similarity processing algorithms for reusing shared metadata and images on a remote server, and to interact with the mobile phone user during image capture to confirm and augment the system supplied metadata. We built a prototype system to evaluate the designed metadata creation process. The main findings were that the creation process could be implemented with current technology and it facilitated the creation of semantic metadata at the time of image capture.</div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The 802.11 IEEE Standard has enabled low cost and effective wireless LAN services (WLAN). With the sales and deployment of WLAN based networks exploding, many people believe that they will become the fourth generation cellular system (4G) or a major portion of it. However, the small cell size of WLAN creates frequent hand-offs for mobile users. If the latency of these hand-offs is high, as previous studies have shown, then the users of synchronous multimedia applications such as voice over IP (VoIP) will experience excessive jitter. The dominating factor in WLAN hand-offs has been shown to be the discovery of the candidate set of next access points. In this paper, we describe the use of a novel and efficient discovery method using <i>neighbor graphs</i> and <i>non-overlap graphs</i>. Our method reduces the total number of probed channels as well as the total time spent waiting on each channel. Our implementation results show that this approach reduces the overall probe time significantly when compared to other approaches. Furthermore, simulation results show that the effectiveness of our method improves as the number of non-overlapping channels increases, such as in the 5 GHz band used by the IEEE 802.11a standard.</div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The proliferation of hotspots based on IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs brings the promise of seamless Internet access from a large number of public locations. However, as the number of users soars, so does the risk of possible misbehavior; to protect themselves, wireless ISPs already make use of a number of security mechanisms, and require mobile stations to authenticate themselves at the Access Points (APs). However, IEEE 802.11 works properly only if the stations also respect the MAC protocol. We show in this paper that a greedy user can substantially increase his share of bandwidth, at the expense of the other users, by slightly modifying the driver of his network adapter. We explain how easily this can be performed, in particular with the new generation of adapters. We then present DOMINO (System for Detection Of greedy behavior in the MAC layer of IEEE 802.11 public NetwOrks), a piece of software to be installed in the Access Point. DOMINO can detect and identify greedy stations, without requiring any modification of the standard protocol at the AP and without revealing its own presence. We illustrate these concepts by simulation results and by the description of our prototype.</div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In June of 2002, Malaysian newsstands carried the latest issue of "Mobile Stuff" - a magazine geared toward Malaysia's growing population of mobile phone subscribers. On the cover, two young Malay men in clothing that suggests more LA hood and less KL suburbs, hold out their mobile phones to the camera beneath the banner headline "Real Men Uses SMS." Six months later, billboards in Shanghai carried the image of a woman" shapely calves and ankles, bound with black patent leather ankle straps; positioned beneath one strap is her mobile phone. Using ethnographic and cultural data from her recent fieldwork in Asia, Bell will explore some of the ways in which mobile technologies are shifting function and form. Beyond their utility as a technology of information exchange, mobile phones specifically and mobile technologies more broadly, appear to have inserted themselves into the cultural fabric of societies across the world. In so doing, while the underlying technologies might not have changed per se, the applications, usage models and indeed, understandings of the objects have undergone radical shifts and re-purposings.</div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

This abstraction allows developers to design distributed algorithms in terms of the neighborhood abstraction itself, instead of decomposing them into component parts such as messaging protocols, data caches, and neighbor lists. In those applications that are already neighborhood-based, this abstraction is shown to facilitate good application design and to reduce algorithmic complexity, inter-component coupling, and total lines of code. The abstraction as defined here has been successfully used to implement several complex applications and is shown to capture the essence of many more existing distributed sensor network algorithms.</div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Computer networks have historically considered support for mobile devices as an extra overhead to be borne by the system. Recently however, researchers have proposed methods by which the network can take advantage of mobile components. We exploit mobility to develop a fluid infrastructure: mobile components are deliberately built into the system infrastructure for enabling specific functionality that is very hard to achieve using other methods. Built-in intelligence helps our system adapt to run time dynamics when pursuing pre-defined performance objectives. Our approach yields significant advantages for energy constrained systems, sparsely deployed networks, delay tolerant networks, and in security sensitive situations. We first show why our approach is advantageous in terms of network lifetime and data fidelity. Second, we present adaptive algorithms that are used to control mobility. Third, we design the communication protocol supporting a fluid infrastructure and long sleep durations on energy-constrained devices. Our algorithms are not based on abstract radio range models or idealized unobstructed environments but founded on real world behavior of wireless devices. We implement a prototype system in which infrastructure components move autonomously to carry out important networking tasks. The prototype is used to validate and evaluate our suggested mobility control methods.</div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper, we investigate the impact of radio irregularity on the communication performance in wireless sensor networks. Radio irregularity is a common phenomenon which arises from multiple factors, such as variance in RF sending power and different path losses depending on the direction of propagation. From our experiments, we discover that the variance in received signal strength is largely random; however, it exhibits a continuous change with incremental changes in direction. With empirical data obtained from the MICA2 platform, we establish a radio model for simulation, called the Radio Irregularity Model (RIM). This model is the first to bridge the discrepancy between spherical radio models used by simulators and the physical reality of radio signals. With this model, we are able to analyze the impact of radio irregularity on some of the well-known MAC and routing protocols. Our results show that radio irregularity has a significant impact on routing protocols, but a relatively small impact on MAC protocols. Finally, we propose six solutions to deal with radio irregularity. We evaluate two of them in detail. The results obtained from both the simulation and a running testbed demonstrate that our solutions greatly improve communication performance in the presence of radio irregularity.</div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

The problem then arises where updates made in the context of an initial transcoding results in content too stringently transcoded for subsequent clients, thereby causing loss of semantic value. We solve this problem by suggesting that the updates themselves can be transformed so that they can be applied directly to the original data instead of to the transcoded data; this approach allows the data to preserve as much semantic value as possible across all heterogeneous clients without unnecessary transcoding artifacts. We define reconciliation rules that can govern the interaction between client updates and transcoding, demonstrate a complete middleware architecture that supports our methodology, and provide two case studies using content-transferring applications. We show that our resulting middleware system executes our reconciliation approach with acceptable latency (under 5 seconds for 200 kbytes of layered content), good scalability, and well-organised modularity.</div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Wireless data broadcast has received a lot of attention from industries and academia in recent years. Access efficiency and energy conservation are two critical performance concerns in a wireless data broadcast environment. To improve the efficiency of energy consumption on mobile devices, traditional disk-based indexing techniques such as B$^+$-tree have been extended to index broadcast data on a wireless channel. However, existing designs are mostly based on centralized tree structures. Most of these indexing techniques are not flexible in the sense that the trade-off between access efficiency and energy conservation is not adjustable based on application specific requirements. We propose in this paper a novel parameterized index, called the <i>exponential index</i>, which can be tuned to optimize the access latency with the tuning time bounded by a given limit, and vice versa. The proposed index is very efficient because it facilitates replication naturally by sharing links in multiple search trees and thus minimizes storage overhead. Experimental results show that the exponential index not only achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art indexes but also enables great flexibility in trade-offs between access latency and tuning time.</div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide26" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">In this paper, we consider the problem of file synchronization when a mobile host shares files with a backbone file server in a network file system. Several <i>diff</i> schemes have been proposed to improve upon the transfer overheads of conventional file synchronization approaches which use full file transfer. These schemes compute the binary <i>diff</i> of the new file with respect to the old copy at the server and transfer the computed <i>diff</i> to the server for file-synchronization. However, Lee et al. have shown that the performance of <i>diff</i> can be significantly improved upon by shipping user operations as opposed to the data itself. Using this as motivation, we present a purely application-unaware approach called <i>Mimic</i> that relies on transferring raw user activity to the server for file synchronization. Through a simple prototype of the proposed approach, we show that Mimic can outperform <i>diff</i> under many common conditions. We also identify conditions under which <i>diff</i> based approaches do perform better than the proposed approach, but show that detection of such conditions is straightforward, thus enabling both schemes to be used in tandem with a mobile file system for bandwidth-efficient file synchronization.</div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

However, developers currently have little support in designing software architectures and in creating interactions that are effective in helping end-users manage their privacy. To address this problem, we present Confab, a toolkit for facilitating the development of privacy-sensitive ubiquitous computing applications. The requirements for Confab were gathered through an analysis of privacy needs for both end-users and application developers. Confab provides basic support for building ubiquitous computing applications, providing a framework as well as several customizable privacy mechanisms. Confab also comes with extensions for managing location privacy. Combined, these features allow application developers and end-users to support a spectrum of trust levels and privacy needs.</div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide30" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We study the problem of tracking a moving device under two indoor location architectures: an <i>active mobile</i> architecture and a <i>passive mobile</i> architecture. In the former, the infrastructure has receivers at known locations, which estimate distances to a mobile device based on an active transmission from the device. In the latter, the infrastructure has active beacons that periodically transmit signals to a passively listening mobile device, which in turn estimates distances to the beacons. Because the active mobile architecture receives simultaneous distance estimates at multiple receivers from the mobile device, it is likely to perform better tracking than the passive mobile system in which the device obtains only one distance estimate at a time and may have moved between successive estimates. However, an passive mobile system scales better with the number of mobile devices and puts users in control of whether their whereabouts are tracked.We answer the following question: How do the two architectures compare in tracking performance? We find that the active mobile architecture performs better at tracking, but that the passive mobile architecture has acceptable performance; moreover, we devise a hybrid approach that preserves the benefits of the passive mobile architecture while simultaneously providing the same performance as an active mobile system, suggesting a viable practical solution to the three goals of scalability, privacy, and tracking agility.</div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide33" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The performance of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs)often suffers from link-layer frame losses caused by noise, interference, multipath, attenuation, and user mobility. We observe that frame losses often occur in bursts and that three of the five main causes of frame losses -- multipath, attenuation, mobility--depends on the transmission path traversed between an access point (AP)and a client station.In a typical WLAN deployment, different transmission paths to a client exist in places where overlapping coverage is provided by a set of neighboring APs. Using experimental measurements and analysis on a 802.11b testbed, we show that fine-grained path selection among a set of neighboring APs can significantly reduce path-dependent losses in WLANs.We design and implement a WLAN distribution system called Divert, which supports fine-grained path selection for downlink communications, on an 802.11b testbed. Divert reduces frame losses without consuming any extra bandwidth in the wireless medium. Our experimental results show that Divert can reduce frame loss rates in realistic scenarios by as much as 26% compared to a fixed-path scheme that uses the best available transmitter.</div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide34" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">We introduce MAR, a commuter mobile access router infrastructure that exploits wireless diversity (e.g. channel diversity, network diversity, and technology diversity) to provide improved data performance for wireless data users. Our system design stems from the observation that rather than choosing a single wireless service provider (e.g. Sprint, AT&amp;T, BT, Vodafone), a single technology (e.g. GPRS, UMTS, CDMA, 802.11), or a single wireless channel, users can obtain significant benefits by using the multiplicity of choices available. MAR is a wireless multi-homed device that can be placed in moving vehicles (e.g. car, bus, train) to enable high-speed data access. MAR dynamically instantiates new channels based on traffic demand, aggregates the bandwidth and dynamically shifts load from poor quality to better quality channels. MAR, thus, provides a faster, more stable, and reliable communication channel to mobile users.We have implemented and tested the MAR system in our testbed which spans the networks of three different cellular providers. Through our experiments we have performed a detailed evaluation to quantify the benefits of MAR for different protocols and applications. For example, even in highly mobile environments, MAR, on average, improves the end-user experience of web-browsing and streaming applications by a factor of 2.8 and 4.4 respectively. Our results show that significant benefits can be obtained by exploiting the diversity in coverage offered by many cellular operators, different technology networks (e.g. GPRS, CDMA), and diverse wireless channels.</div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide35" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Many approaches exist today that address the issues that arise when a mobile node changes its point(s) of attachment to the Internet. Mobile IP takes care of host mobility at the IP layer; others at the transport layer (Mobile SCTP) or at the application layer (SIP with re-invite). In practice, most of these approaches rely on functionality residing on the mobile host that scans, detects and activates the networks available through one or more network interfaces.The mechanism proposed in this paper takes into account that multiple of these approaches may be applied at the same time. It provides the applications on the mobile host with information about the state of the lower-layer mobility management protocols (such as Mobile IP) as well as the state and characteristics of the available network resources. Applications may consecutively adapt their behavior depending on this mobility process information and thus accommodate to the changed network connectivity conditions, possibly in an application specific manner. In this paper, we present the architecture of our mobility management mechanism. We also describe the implementation of our prototype and the results of experiments with the mechanism, thereby addressing the complexities of an integrated application-aware mobility management system.</div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

The paper addresses both details of the terminal devices and communication protocols, as well as testing of the system in a real environment. The ES system was originally made to address special needs for sheep and reindeer farmers who were seeking a system to keep track of their animals during the grazing season. The system, including GPS receivers, UHF radio communication transceivers and GPRS modems, contributes a new approach for low-cost networking and service implementation, not only for the purpose of animal tracking, but also for other applications where objects are to be monitored at a low cost.</div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">ZebraNet is a mobile, wireless sensor network in which nodes move throughout an environment working to gather and process information about their surroundings[10]. As in many sensor or wireless systems, nodes have critical resource constraints such as processing speed, memory size, and energy supply; they also face special hardware issues such as sensing device sample time, data storage/access restrictions, and wireless transceiver capabilities. This paper discusses and evaluates ZebraNet's system design decisions in the face of a range of real-world constraints.Impala---ZebraNet's middleware layer---serves as a light-weight operating system, but also has been designed to encourage application modularity, simplicity, adaptivity, and repairability. Impala is now implemented on ZebraNet hardware nodes, which include a 16-bit microcontroller, a low-power GPS unit, a 900MHz radio, and 4Mbits of non-volatile FLASH memory. This paper discusses Impala's operation scheduling and event handling model, and explains how system constraints and goals led to the interface designs we chose between the application, middleware, and firmware layers. We also describe Impala's network interface which unifies media access control and transport control into an efficient network protocol. With the minimum overhead in communication, buffering, and processing, it supports a range of message models, all inspired by and tailored to ZebraNet's application needs. By discussing design tradeoffs in the context of a real hardware system and a real sensor network application, this paper's design choices and performance measurements offer some concrete experiences with software systems issues for the mobile sensor design space. More generally, we feel that these experiences can guide design choices in a range of related systems.</div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide40" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The focus of surveillance missions is to acquire and verify information about enemy capabilities and positions of hostile targets. Such missions often involve a high element of risk for human personnel and require a high degree of stealthiness. Hence, the ability to deploy unmanned surveillance missions, by using wireless sensor networks, is of great practical importance for the military. Because of the energy constraints of sensor devices, such systems necessitate an energy-aware design to ensure the longevity of surveillance missions. Solutions proposed recently for this type of system show promising results through simulations. However, the simplified assumptions they make about the system in the simulator often do not hold well in practice and energy consumption is narrowly accounted for within a single protocol. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a running system for energy-efficient surveillance. The system allows a group of cooperating sensor devices to detect and track the positions of moving vehicles in an energy-efficient and stealthy manner. We can trade off energy-awareness and surveillance performance by adaptively adjusting the sensitivity of the system. We evaluate the performance on a network of 70 MICA2 motes equipped with dual-axis magnetometers. Our results show that our surveillance strategy is adaptable and achieves a significant extension of network lifetime. Finally, we share lessons learned in building such a complete running system.</div></span> <a id="expcoll40" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll40',40)">expand</a>
