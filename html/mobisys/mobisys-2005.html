<span id="toHide3" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">LiveMail is a prototype system that allows mobile subscribers to communicate using personalized 3D face models created from images taken by their phone cameras. The user takes a snapshot of someone's face - a friend, famous person, themselves, even a pet - using the mobile phone's camera. After a quick manipulation on the phone, a 3D model of that face is created and can be animated simply by typing in some text. Speech and appropriate animation of the face are created automatically by speech synthesis. Animations can be sent to others as real 3D animated messages or as short videos in MMS. They can be used as fun messages, greeting cards etc. The system is based on a client/server communication model. The clients are mobile devices or web clients so messages can be created, sent and received on the mobile phone or on a web page. The client has a user interface that allows the user to input a facial image and place a simple mask on it to mark the main features. The client then sends this data to a server that builds a personalized face model. The client also provides an interface that lets the user request the creation of animated messages using speech synthesis. It is planned to have several versions of the client: Symbian, midlet-based, web-based, wap-based, etc. The server is responsible for sending messages adjusted to the capabilities of the receiving platform. The server, Symbian client, midlet-based client and the web client have been implemented as prototypes. We present the system architecture and the experience gained building LiveMail.</div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

Multimedia processing algorithms detect and isolate relevant video segments from over twenty television broadcast programs based on a collection or words and phrases specified by the user. Content repurposing techniques are then used to convert the information into a form that is suitable for delivery to the user's mobile devices. Alerts are sent using a number of application messaging and network access protocols including email, short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service (MMS), voice, session initiation protocol (SIP), fax, and pager protocols. The system is evaluated with respect to performance and user experiences.

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">
<p>This paper presents a new pairing protocol that allows two
CPU-constrained wireless devices Alice and Bob to establish a
shared secret at a very low cost. To our knowledge, this is the
first software pairing scheme that does not rely on expensive
public-key cryptography, out-of-band channels (such as a keyboard
or a display) or specific hardware, making it inexpensive and
suitable for CPU-constrained devices such as sensors.</p>
<p>In the described protocol, Alice can send the secret bit 1 to
Bob by broadcasting an (empty) packet with the source field set to
Alice. Similarly, Alice can send the secret bit 0 to Bob by
broadcasting an (empty) packet with the source field set to Bob.
Only Bob can identify the real source of the packet (since it did
not send it, the source is Alice), and can recover the secret bit
(1 if the source is set to Alice or 0 otherwise). An eavesdropper
cannot retrieve the secret bit since it cannot figure out whether
the packet was actually sent by Alice or Bob. By randomly
generating <i>n</i> such packets Alice and Bob can agree on an
<i>n</i>-bit secret key.</p>
<p>Our scheme requires that the devices being paired, Alice and
Bob, are shaken during the key exchange protocol. This is to
guarantee that an eavesdropper cannot identify the packets sent by
Alice from those sent by Bob using data from the RSSI (Received
Signal Strength Indicator) registers available in commercial
wireless cards. The proposed protocol works with off-the-shelf
802.11 wireless cards and is secure against eavesdropping attacks
that use power analysis. It requires, however, some firmware
changes to protect against attacks that attempt to identify the
source of packets from their transmission frequency.</p>

With this approach, the computer boots from the device and resumes the virtual machine, thus giving the user access to his personal environment, including previously running computations. <i>SoulPad</i> has minimal infrastructure requirements and is therefore applicable to a wide range of conditions, particularly in developing countries.

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Given a sufficiently good network connection, even a handheld computer can run extremely resource-intensive applications by executing the demanding portions on a remote server. At first glance, the increasingly ubiquitous deployment of wireless hotspots seems to offer the connectivity needed for remote execution. However, we show that the backhaul connection from the hotspot to the Internet can be a prohibitive bottleneck for interactive applications. To eliminate this bottleneck, we propose a new architecture, called Slingshot, that replicates remote application state on surrogate computers co-located with wireless access points. The first-class replica of each application executes on a remote server owned by the handheld user; this offers a safe haven for application state in the event of surrogate failure. Slingshot deploys second-class replicas on nearby surrogates to improve application response time. A proxy on the handheld broadcasts each application request to all replicas and returns the first response it receives. We have modified a speech recognizer and a remote desktop to use Slingshot. Our results show that these applications execute 2.6 times faster with Slingshot than with remote execution.</div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Recently, there has been an increasing interest in wireless broadcast systems as a means to enable scalable content delivery to large numbers of mobile users. However, gracefully providing efficient reconciliation of different versions of a file over such broadcast channels still remains a challenge. Such systems often lack a feedback channel and consequently updates cannot be easily tailored to a specific user. Moreover, given the potentially large number of possible versions of a file, it is impractical to send a tailored update for each particular user.In this paper we consider the problem of efficiently updating files in such wireless broadcast channels. To this extent, we present DeltaCast, a system that combines hierarchical hashes and erasure codes to minimise the amount of battery power and the amount of time needed to synchronise each mobile device. Based on our experimental results, we show that DeltaCast is able to efficiently identify the missing portions of a file and quickly updated each client.</div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Multi-homed mobile hosts situated in physical proximity may spontaneously team up to run high-bandwidth applications by pooling their low wireless wide-area network (WWAN) bandwidths together for communication with a remote application server and utilizing their high-bandwidth wireless local-area network (WLAN) in ad-hoc mode for aggregation and distribution of application contents among the participating mobile hosts. In this paper, we first describe the need for such a mobile collaborative community, or a community, in which multi-homed mobile hosts exploit the diversity of WWAN connections to improve a user-perceived bandwidth and network utilization. Then, we show that existing one-to-one communication protocols like TCP suffer significant performance degradation due to frequent packet reordering and heterogeneity of WWAN links in the community.To address the above TCP problem, we propose a proxy-based inverse multiplexer, called <i>PRISM</i>, that enables TCP to efficiently utilize the community members' WWAN connections. PRISM runs at a proxy's network layer as a routing component and stripes each TCP flow over multiple WWAN links by exploiting the transport-layer feedback information. Moreover, it masks variety of adverse effects specific to each WWAN link via intelligent ACK-control mechanism. Finally, PRISM includes a sender-side enhancement of congestion control, enabling TCP to respond correctly to dynamically-changing network states.We have evaluated the PRISM protocol using both experimentation and <i>ns</i>-2-based simulation. Our experimental evaluation has shown PRISM to improve TCP's performance by up to 310% even with two collaborative mobile hosts. Our in-depth simulation study also shows that PRISM delivers a near-optimal aggregated bandwidth in the community formed by heterogeneous mobile hosts, and improves network utilization significantly.</div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Inverse multiplexing, or network striping, allows the construction of a high-bandwidth virtual channel from a collection of multiple low-bandwidth network channels. Striping systems usually employ an immutable packet scheduling policy and allow applications to be oblivious of the way in which packets are routed to specific network channels. Though this is appropriate for many applications, other applications can benefit from an approach that explicitly involves the application in the dynamic determination of the striping policy.Horde is middleware that facilitates flexible striping in wireless environments for a diverse range of applications. Horde separates the striping policy from routing and scheduling. It allows applications to specify network quality-of-service objectives that the striping mechanism attempts to satisfy. Horde can be used by a set of application data streams, each with its own quality-of-service policy, to flexibly stripe data over a highly heterogeneous set of dynamically varying wireless network channels.We present the Horde architecture, describe an early implementation, and examine how different policies can be used to modulate the quality-of-service observed across different independent data streams.</div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">The widespread availability of 802.11-based hardware has made it the premier choice of both researchers and practitioners for developing new wireless networks and applications. However, the ever increasing set of demands posed by these applications is stretching the 802.11 MAC protocol beyond its intended capabilities. For example, 802.11 provides no control over allocation of resources, and the default allocation policy is ill-suited for heterogeneous environments and multi-hop networks. Fairness problems are further exacerbated in multi-hop networks due to link asymmetry and hidden terminals. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing these problems <i>without</i> replacing the MAC layer by presenting the design and the implementation of an <i>Overlay MAC Layer</i> (OML), that works on top of the 802.11 MAC layer. OML uses loosely-synchronized clocks to divide the time in to equal size slots, and employs a distributed algorithm to allocate these slots among competing nodes. We have implemented OML in both a simulator and on a wireless testbed using the Click modular router. Our evaluation shows that OML can not only provide better flexibility but also improve the fairness, throughput and predictability of 802.11 networks.</div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide18" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Sensor network nodes exhibit characteristics of both embedded systems and general-purpose systems. They must use little energy and be robust to environmental conditions, while also providing common services that make it easy to write applications. In TinyOS, the current state of the art in sensor node operating systems, reusable components implement common services, but each node runs a single statically-linked system image, making it hard to run multiple applications or incrementally update applications. We present SOS, a new operating system for mote-class sensor nodes that takes a more dynamic point on the design spectrum. SOS consists of dynamically-loaded modules and a common kernel, which implements messaging, dynamic memory, and module loading and unloading, among other services. Modules are not processes: they are scheduled cooperatively and there is no memory protection. Nevertheless, the system protects against common module bugs using techniques such as typed entry points, watchdog timers, and primitive resource garbage collection. Individual modules can be added and removed with minimal system interruption. We describe SOS's design and implementation, discuss tradeoffs, and compare it with TinyOS and with the Maté virtual machine. Our evaluation shows that despite the dynamic nature of SOS and its higher-level kernel interface, its long term total usage nearly identical to that of systems such as Matè and TinyOS.</div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

Existing systems that provide position information to mobile computers are reliant on externally deployed infrastructure, such as beacons or sensors in the environment. We introduce the <i>Relate</i> system, which provides fine-grained relative position information to co-located devices on the basis of peer-to-peer sensing, thus overcoming dependence on any external infrastructure. The system is realised as a hardware/software plug-in, using ultrasound for peer-to-peer sensing, USB to interface with standard mobile devices, and data abstraction and inferencing to map sensor data to a spatial model that maintains both quantitative and qualitative relationships. We present a set of services and applications to demonstrate the utility of the system.

The wireless network provides a synchronizing pulse along with information about the room. This is accompanied by an ultrasound beacon that allows us to resolve locations to the confines of a physical room (since audio is mostly bounded by walls). We generate the wireless data and ultrasound pulses from the existing PCs in each room; a PDA carried by a user listens for both signals. Thus, our approach does not require special hardware. We do not use ultrasound to send data. As a result we dramatically reduce the computational burden on the mobile device while also decreasing the latency of location resolution. Our results indicate that (i) ultrasound detection is robust even in noisy environments with many reflective surfaces; and (ii) that we can determine the correct room within a couple of seconds with high probability even when the ultrasound emitting PCs are not synchronized.</div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

It uses location-clustering techniques to reduce the computational requirements of the algorithm. The lightweight <i>Horus</i> algorithm helps in supporting a larger number of users by running the algorithm at the clients.We discuss the different components of the <i>Horus</i> system and its implementation under two different operating systems and evaluate the performance of the <i>Horus</i> system on two testbeds.

It has an error of less than 0.6 meter on the average and its computational requirements are more than an order of magnitude better than other WLAN location determination systems. Moreover, the techniques developed in the context of the <i>Horus</i> system are general and can be applied to other WLAN location determination systems to enhance their accuracy.

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Location-aware systems are typically deployed on a small scale and evaluated technically, in terms of absolute errors. In this paper, the authors present their experience of deploying an indoor location system (the Bat system) over a larger area and running it for a period exceeding two years.A number of technical considerations are highlighted: a need to consider aesthetics throughout deployment, the disadvantages of specialising sensors for location only, the need for autonomous maintenance of the computational world model, the dangers in coinciding physical and symbolic boundaries, the need to design for space usage rather than space and the need to incorporate feed-back mechanisms and power management. An evaluation of long term user experiences is presented, derived from a survey, logged usage data, and empirical observations. Statistically, it is found that 35% wear their Bat daily, 35% characterise their Bat as useful, privacy concerns are rare for almost 90% of users, and users cite the introduction of more applications and the adoption of the system by other users as their chief incentives to be tracked.Thia paper aims to highlight the need to evaluate large-scale deployments of such systems both technically and through user studies.</div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Location systems have long been identified as an important component of emerging mobile applications. Most research on location systems has focused on precise location in indoor environments. However, many location applications (for example, location-aware web search) become interesting only when the underlying location system is available ubiquitously and is not limited to a single office environment. Unfortunately, the installation and calibration overhead involved for most of the existing research systems is too prohibitive to imagine deploying them across, say, an entire city. In this work, we evaluate the feasibility of building a wide-area 802.11 Wi-Fi-based positioning system. We compare a suite of wireless-radio-based positioning algorithms to understand how they can be adapted for such ubiquitous deployment with minimal calibration. In particular, we study the impact of this limited calibration on the accuracy of the positioning algorithms. Our experiments show that we can estimate a user's position with a median positioning error of 13-40 meters (depending upon the characteristics of the environment). Although this accuracy is lower than existing positioning systems, it requires substantially lower calibration overhead and provides easy deployment and coverage across large metropolitan areas.</div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide27" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Energy efficiency has become a critical issue for battery-driven computers. Significant work has been devoted to improving it through better software and hardware. However, the human factors and user interfaces have often been ignored. Realizing their extreme importance, we devote this work to a comprehensive treatment of their role in determining and improving energy efficiency. We analyze the minimal energy requirements and overheads imposed by known human sensory/speed limits. We then characterize energy efficiency for state-of-the-art interfaces available on two commercial handheld computers. Based on the characterization, we offer a comparative study for them.Even with a perfect user interface, computers will still spend most of their time and energy waiting for user responses due to an increasingly large speed gap between users and computers in their interactions. Such a speed gap leads to a bottleneck in system energy efficiency. We propose a low-power low-cost cache device, to which the host computer can outsource simple tasks, as an interface solution to overcome the bottleneck. We discuss the design and prototype implementation of a low-power wireless wrist-watch for use as a cache device for interfacing.With this work, we wish to engender more interest in the mobile system design community in investigating the impact of user interfaces on system energy efficiency and to harvest the opportunities thus exposed.</div></span> <a id="expcoll27" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll27',27)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide28" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline">Maintaining optimal consistency in a distributed system requires that nodes be always-on to synchronize information. Unfortunately, mobile devices such as laptops do not have adequate battery capacity for constant processing and communication. Even by powering off unnecessary components, such as the screen and disk, current laptops only have a lifetime of a few hours. Although PDAs and sensors are similarly limited in lifetime, a PDA's power requirement is an order-of-magnitude smaller than a laptop's, and a sensor's is an order-of-magnitude smaller than a PDA's. By combining these diverse platforms into a single integrated laptop, we can reduce the power cost of always-on operation. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Turducken, a Hierarchical Power Management architecture for mobile systems. We focus on a particular instantiation of HPM, which provides high levels of consistency in a laptop by integrating two additional low power processors. We demonstrate that a Turducken system can provide battery lifetimes of up to <i>ten times</i> that of a standard laptop for always-on operation and <i>three times</i> for a system that periodically sleeps.</div></span> <a id="expcoll28" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll28',28)">expand</a>
