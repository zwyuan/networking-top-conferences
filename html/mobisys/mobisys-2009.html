Prior works assume trusted infrastructure, require an individual to trust unknown entities, or provide relatively low probabilistic guarantees of authenticity (95% for realistic settings). This work presents SPATE, a primitive that allows users to establish trust via device mobility and physical interaction. Once the SPATE protocol runs to completion, its participants' mobile devices have authentic data that their applications can use to interact securely (i.e., the probability of a successful attack is 2<sup>-24</sup>). For this work, we leverage SPATE as part of a larger system to facilitate efficient, secure, and user-friendly collaboration via email and file-sharing services. Our implementation of SPATE on Nokia N70 smartphones allows users to establish trust in small groups of up to eight users in less than one minute. The two example SPATE applications provide increased security with no overhead noticeable to users once keys are established.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll3" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll3',3)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Loaded with personal data, e.g. photos, contacts, and call history, mobile phones are truly personal devices. Yet it is often necessary or desirable to share our phones with others. This is especially true as mobile phones are integrating features conventionally provided by other dedicated devices, from MP3 players to games consoles. Unfortunately, when we lend our phones to others, we give away complete access because existing phones assume a single user and provide little protection for private data and applications. In this work, we present xShare, a protection solution to address this problem. xShare allows phone owners to rapidly specify what they want to share and place the phone into a restricted mode where only the data and applications intended for sharing can be accessed.</p> <p>We first present findings from two motivational user studies based on which we provide the design requirements of xShare. We then present the design of xShare based on file-level access control. We describe the implementation of xShare on Windows Mobile and report a comprehensive usability evaluation of the implementation, including mea-surements and user studies. The evaluation demonstrates that our xShare implementation has negligible overhead for interactive phone usage, is extremely favored by mobile users, and provides robust protection against attacks by experienced Windows Mobile users and developers.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

Specifically, we investigate the Skyhook positioning system, available on PCs and used on a number of mobile platforms, including Apple's iPod touch and iPhone. By implementing and analyzing several kinds of attacks, we demonstrate that this system is vulnerable to location spoofing and location database manipulation. In both, the attacker can arbitrarily change the result of the localization at the victim device, by either impersonating remote infrastructure or by tampering with the service database. Our attacks can easily be replicated and we conjecture that--without appropriate countermeasures--public WLAN-based positioning should therefore be used with caution in safety-critical contexts. We further discuss several approaches for securing WLAN-based positioning systems.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide8" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Despite Bluetooth's popularity, low cost, and low power requirements, Bluetooth applications remain remarkably unsophisticated. Although the research community and industry have designed games, cell-phone backup, and contextual advertising systems with Bluetooth, few such applications have been prototyped or evaluated on a large scale. Evaluating Bluetooth applications requires recruiting devices in the wild and developing robust software that can adapt to the heterogeneity of these devices. These requirements have limited both the number and the magnitude of the experiments with Bluetooth applications.</p> <p>This paper proposes BlueMonarch, a systemfor evaluating Bluetooth applications in the wild. BlueMonarch emulates a Bluetooth transfer to any device responding to Bluetooth Service Discovery requests; because many cell-phones, laptops, and PDAs in the wild respond to such probes, BlueMonarch enables quick prototyping of Bluetooth applications in the wild, to hundreds of unmodified Bluetooth devices. After we present the feasibility and accuracy of BlueMonarch, we use BlueMonarch to evaluate a content delivery system for Bluetooth. With BlueMonarch, we evaluated our system inside a mall and a subway system; we were able to send tens of megabytes of data to hundreds of Bluetooth devices in just a little over an hour.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll8" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll8',8)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>PEIR, the Personal Environmental Impact Report, is a participatory sensing application that uses location data sampled from everyday mobile phones to calculate personalized estimates of environmental impact and exposure. It is an example of an important class of emerging mobile systems that combine the distributed processing capacity of the web with the personal reach of mobile technology. This paper documents and evaluates the running PEIR system, which includes mobile handset based GPS location data collection, and server-side processing stages such as HMM-based activity classification (to determine transportation mode); automatic location data segmentation into "trips''; lookup of traffic, weather, and other context data needed by the models; and environmental impact and exposure calculation using efficient implementations of established models. Additionally, we describe the user interface components of PEIR and present usage statistics from a two month snapshot of system use. The paper also outlines new algorithmic components developed based on experience with the system and undergoing testing for integration into PEIR, including: new map-matching and GSM-augmented activity classification techniques, and a selective hiding mechanism that generates believable proxy traces for times a user does not want their real location revealed.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) deployments are becoming increasingly popular in both industrial and consumer-oriented settings. To effectively exploit and operate such deployments, important challenges must be addressed, from managing RFID data streams to handling limitations in reader accuracy and coverage. Furthermore, deployments that support pervasive computing raise additional issues related to user acceptance and system utility. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a four-week study of a building-scale EPC Class-1 Generation-2 RFID deployment, the "RFID Ecosystem", with 47 readers (160 antennas) installed throughout an 8,000 square meter building. During the study, 67 participants having over 300 tags accessed the collected RFID data through applications including an object finder and a friend tracker and several tools for managing personal data. We found that our RFID deployment produces a very manageable amount of data overall, but with orders of magnitude difference among various participants and objects. We also find that the tag detection rates tend to be low with high variance across the type of tag, participant and object. Users need expert guidance to effectively mount their tags and are encouraged by compelling applications to wear tags more frequently. Finally, probabilistic modeling and inference techniques promise to enable more complex applications by smoothing over gaps and errors in the data, but must be applied with care as they add significant computational and storage overhead.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide13" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile devices often store data in reduced resolutions or custom formats in order to accommodate resource constraints and tailor-made software. The Polyjuz framework enables sharing and synchronization of data across a collection of personal devices that use formats of different fidelity. Layered transparently between the application and an off-the-shelf replication platform, Polyjuz bridges the isolated worlds of different data formats. With Polyjuz, data items created or updated on high-fidelity devices-such as laptops and desktops-are automatically replicated onto low-fidelity, mobile devices. Similarly, data items updated on low-fidelity devices are reintegrated with their high-fidelity counterparts, when the application permits it. Polyjuz performs these fidelity reductions and reintegrations as devices exchange data in a peer-to-peer manner, ultimately extending the eventual-consistency guarantee of the underlying replication platform to the multi-fidelity universe.</p> <p>In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Polyjuz and demonstrate its benefits for a fidelity-aware contacts-management application.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll13" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll13',13)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>The Web has become the host platform for interactive and collaborative applications that usually consist of multiple Web services. This transition is pushing the browsers to perform operating system like functionalities for better resource utilization. Unfortunately, there exists limited support for resource management on current Web platforms. This problem is further aggravated on mobile devices because of their limited resources. If current Web communication APIs were used as-is, mobile users would suffer from low responsiveness, battery drainage, and expensive charges.</p> <p>This paper describes the design and implementation of Mobile Ajax Broker (or MaJaB), a middleware layer that performs management and coordination of networking activities of multiple Web services residing in a Web page. MaJaB integrates a range of optimization techniques that were typically applied at the OS level including scheduling, multiplexing, piggybacking, and priority-switching. This work has been implemented as part of EasyMeet, a Web service that enables anytime, anywhere conference participation using any device. MaJaB is built using standard Web technologies to promote easy deployment across platforms.</p> <p>We have evaluated MaJaB over a real-world workload that we observed during our four-month pilot of EasyMeet. Our results show that MaJaB was successful in achieving its goal and, compared to a naive implementation, reduced the percentage of CPU busy periods by 99%, energy consumption by 21%, and network traffic by 25-81% for different participants. While all those improvements result in better user experience, the reduction in network traffic in particular can translate into over $800 saving in international roaming even for a two-user meeting that lasts only for an hour.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide15" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p><i>Mobility footprint</i> refers to the size, weight, and energy demand of the hardware that must be carried by a mobile user to be effective at any time and place. The ideal of a zero mobility footprint is achievable by encapsulating personal computing state in a virtual machine (VM) and delivering it over the Internet to a locally-obtained computer close to the user. In locations with poor Internet connectivity, the demands placed on WAN bandwidth can result in unacceptable user experience. We show how this challenge can be overcome by using nascent smart phone technology as a trusted personal assistant called <i>Horatio</i> that serves as <i>a self-cleaning portable cache for VM state</i>. Since most users already carry cell phones for voice calls and texting, Horatio does not increase the size or weight aspects of a user's mobility footprint - there is only a small increase in the energy aspect. We have built an experimental prototype of Horatio, and measurements confirm its ability to improve user experience even with current smart phone limitations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

Unfortunately, there is currently no way for users to determine which hotspot access points (APs) will be sufficient to run their applications before purchasing access. To address this problem, this paper presents <i>Wifi-Reports</i>, a collaborative service that provides Wi-Fi clients with historical information about AP performance and application support. The key research challenge in Wifi-Reports is to obtain accurate user-submitted reports. This is challenging because two conflicting goals must be addressed in a practical system: preserving the privacy of users' reports and limiting fraudulent reports. We introduce a practical cryptographic protocol that achieves both goals, and we address the important engineering challenges in building Wifi-Reports. Using a measurement study of commercial APs in Seattle, we show that Wifi-Reports would improve performance over previous AP selection approaches in 30%-60% of locations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll18" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll18',18)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Point&amp;Connect (P&amp;C) offers an intuitive and resilient device pairing solution on standard mobile phones. Its operation follows the simple sequence of <i>point</i>-and<i>connect</i>: when a user plans to pair her mobile phone with another device nearby, she makes a simple hand gesture that points her phone towards the intended target. The system will capture the user's gesture, understand the target selection intention, and complete the device pairing. P&amp;C is intention-based, intuitive, and reduces user efforts in device pairing. The main technical challenge is to come up with a simple system technique to effectively capture and understand the intention of the user, and pick the right device among many others nearby. It should further work on any mobile phones or small devices without relying on infrastructure or special hardware. P&amp;C meets this challenge with a novel collaborative scheme to measure maximum distance change based on acoustic signals. Using only a speaker and a microphone, P&amp;C can be implemented solely in user-level software and work on COTS phones. P&amp;C adds additional mechanisms to improve resiliency against imperfect user actions, acoustic disturbance, and even certain malicious attacks. We have implemented P&amp;C in Windows Mobile phones and conducted extensive experimental evaluation, and showed that it is a cool and effective way to perform device pairing.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>An increasing trend in mobile and pervasive computing is the augmentation of everyday public spaces with local computation - leading to so called smart environments. However, there are no well accepted techniques for supporting spontaneous interaction between mobile users and these smart environments, though a wide range of techniques have been explored ranging from gesture recognition to downloading applications to a user's phone. In this paper we explore an approach to supporting such interaction based on the use of Bluetooth Device (user-friendly) Names as a control channel between users' mobile phones and computational resources in their local environment. Such an approach has many advantages over existing techniques though it is not without limitations. Our work focuses specifically on the use of Device Names to control and customize applications on large public displays in a campus environment. This paper describes our basic approach, a number of applications that we have constructed using this technique and the results of our evaluation work which has included a range of user studies and field trials. The paper concludes with an assessment of the viability of using our approach for interaction scenarios involving mobile users and computationally rich environments.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide23" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Top end mobile phones include a number of specialized (e.g., accelerometer, compass, GPS) and general purpose sensors (e.g., microphone, camera) that enable new people-centric sensing applications. Perhaps the most ubiquitous and unexploited sensor on mobile phones is the microphone - a powerful sensor that is capable of making sophisticated inferences about human activity, location, and social events from sound. In this paper, we exploit this untapped sensor not in the context of human communications but as an enabler of new sensing applications. We propose SoundSense, a scalable framework for modeling sound events on mobile phones. SoundSense is implemented on the Apple iPhone and represents the first general purpose sound sensing system specifically designed to work on resource limited phones. The architecture and algorithms are designed for scalability and Soundsense uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to classify both general sound types (e.g., music, voice) and discover novel sound events specific to individual users. The system runs solely on the mobile phone with no back-end interactions. Through implementation and evaluation of two proof of concept people-centric sensing applications, we demostrate that SoundSense is capable of recognizing meaningful sound events that occur in users' everyday lives.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll23" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll23',23)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Urban sensing, participatory sensing, and user activity recognition can provide rich contextual information for mobile applications such as social networking and location-based services. However, continuously capturing this contextual information on mobile devices consumes huge amount of energy. In this paper, we present a novel design framework for an Energy Efficient Mobile Sensing System (EEMSS). EEMSS uses hierarchical sensor management strategy to recognize user states as well as to detect state transitions. By powering only a minimum set of sensors and using appropriate sensor duty cycles EEMSS significantly improves device battery life. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of EEMSS that automatically recognizes a set of users' daily activities in real time using sensors on an off-the-shelf high-end smart phone. Evaluation of EEMSS with 10 users over one week shows that our approach increases the device battery life by more than 75% while maintaining both high accuracy and low latency in identifying transitions between end-user activities.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

In this paper we outline a methodology for extracting the temporal properties, in terms of start time and duration, of sensor data streams that can be used in applications such as human, habitat, environmental and traffic monitoring where sensed events repeat over a time window. Its application is demonstrated on a 30-day dataset collected from one of our assisted living sensor network deployments.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. Furthermore, tracking has to robustly deliver position updates when faced with changing conditions such as delays due to positioning and communication, and changing positioning accuracy.</p> <p>This work proposes EnTracked - a system that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. The realized system tracks pedestrian targets equipped with GPS-enabled devices. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between energy consumption and robustness.</p> <p>We provide extensive experimental results by profiling how devices consume power, by emulation on collected data and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from this profiling show how a device consumes power while tracking its position. Results from the emulation indicate that the system can estimate and predict system conditions and mobility. Furthermore they provide evidence for that the system can lower the energy consumption considerably and remain robust when faced with changing system conditions. By validation in several real-world deployments we provide evidence that the real system works as predicted by the emulation.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

Directionality and base station-diversity are two well-known, independently developed mechanisms for improving the uplink connectivity of mobile clients. In this paper, we highlight that a system combining both mechanisms can achieve significant improvement in performance with multi-lobe beams that strike a tradeoff between directionality and diversity. This is in contrast to the mere steering of narrow beams used in conventional smart antenna systems. For tractability at vehicular speeds, our <b>R2D2</b> system searches through a limited set of beam patterns with different numbers of lobes, and includes a two-stage algorithm that uses both runtime adaptation and cached candidate patterns. We design and evaluate several variants of run-time adaptation that tune the number and angle of lobes in the beam, and the bit rate. The design of these algorithms is guided by both analysis and real-world measurements with a smart antenna system mounted on a vehicle. These measurements with our prototype implementation show that <b>R2D2</b> can achieve an uplink throughput increase of up to 154% over pure beamsteering and 45% over pure basestation diversity.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

In particular, the Wi-Fi interface has high throughput and transfer power efficiency, but its idle power consumption is prohibitive.

<span id="toHide34" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>With the proliferation of WiFi technology, many WiFi networks are accessible from vehicles on the road making vehicular WiFi access realistic. However, several challenges exist: long latency to establish connection to a WiFi access point (AP), lossy link performance, and frequent disconnections due to mobility. We argue that people drive on familiar routes frequently, and thus the mobility and connectivity related information along their drives can be predicted with good accuracy using historical information - such as GPS tracks with timestamps, RF fingerprints, and link and network-layer addresses of visible APs. We exploit such information to develop new <i>handoff and data transfer</i> strategies. The handoff strategy reduces the connection establishment latency and also uses pre-scripted handoffs triggered by change in vehicle location. The data transfer strategy speeds up download performance by using prefetching on the APs yet to be encountered. Experimental performance evaluation reveals that the predictability of mobility and connectivity is high enough to be useful in such protocols. In our experiments with a vehicular client accessing road-side APs, the handoff strategy improves download performance by roughly a factor of 2 relative to the state-of-the-art. The data transfer strategy further improves this performance by another factor of 2.5.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile devices are becoming a primary medium for personal information gathering, management, and sharing. Managing personal image data on mobile platforms is a difficult problem due to large data set size, content diversity, heterogeneous individual usage patterns, and resource constraints. This article presents a user-centric system, called iScope, for personal image management and sharing on mobile devices. iScope uses multi-modality clustering of both content and context information for efficient image management and search, and online learning techniques for predicting images of interest. It also supports distributed content-based search among networked devices while maintaining the same intuitive interface, enabling efficient information sharing among people. We have implemented iScope and conducted in-field experiments using networked Nokia N810 portable Internet tablets. Energy efficiency was a primary design focus during the design and implementation of the iScope search algorithms. Experimental results indicate that iScope improves search time and search energy by 4.1X and 3.8X on average, relative to browsing.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide38" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a near-field communication-based mobile p2p payment application, called mFerio, that is designed to replace cash-based transactions. We first identify design criteria that payment systems should satisfy and then explain how mFerio, relative to those criteria, improves on the limitations of cash-based systems. We next describe mFerio's implementation and user interface design, focusing on the balance between usability and security. Finally, we present the results of a two-phase user study, involving a total of 104 people, that shows that mFerio has low cognitive load and is also fast, accurate, and easy to use - even outperforming cash in terms of speed and cognitive load in common payment situations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents the design and deployment experience of an air-dropped wireless sensor network for volcano hazard monitoring. The deployment of five stations into the rugged crater of Mount St. Helens only took one hour with a helicopter. The stations communicate with each other through an amplified 802.15.4 radio and establish a self-forming and self-healing multi-hop wireless network. The distance between stations is up to 2 km. Each sensor station collects and delivers real-time continuous seismic, infrasonic, lightning, GPS raw data to a gateway. The main contribution of this paper is the design and evaluation of a robust sensor network to replace data loggers and provide real-time long-term volcano monitoring. The system supports UTC-time synchronized data acquisition with 1ms accuracy, and is online configurable. It has been tested in the lab environment, the outdoor campus and the volcano crater. Despite the heavy rain, snow, and ice as well as gusts exceeding 120 miles per hour, the sensor network has achieved a remarkable packet delivery ratio above 99% with an overall system uptime of about 93.8% over the 1.5 months evaluation period after deployment. Our initial deployment experiences with the system have alleviated the doubts of domain scientists and prove to them that a low-cost sensor network system can support real-time monitoring in extremely harsh environments.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide42" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>To ensure sustainable operations of wireless sensor systems, environmental energy harvesting has been regarded as the right solution for long-term applications. In energy-dynamic environments, energy conservation is no longer considered necessarily beneficial, because energy storage units (e.g., batteries or capacitors) are limited in capacity and leakage-prone. In contrast to legacy energy conservation approaches, we aim at energy synchronization for wireless sensor devices. The starting point of this work is TwinStar, which uses ultra-capacitor as the only energy storage unit. To efficiently use the harvested energy, we design and implement leakage-aware feedback control techniques to match local and network-wide activity of sensor nodes with the dynamic energy supply from environments. We conduct system evaluation under three typical real-world settings - indoor, outdoor, and mobile backpack under a wide range of system settings. Results indicate our leakage-aware control can effectively utilize energy that could otherwise leak away. Nodes running leakage-aware control can enjoy 70% more energy than the ones running non-leakage-aware control and application performance (e.g., event detection) can be improved significantly.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide43" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>In this paper, we present a reliable storage service, called SolarStore, that adaptively trades-off storage reliability versus energy consumption in solar-powered sensor networks. SolarStore adopts a predominantly disconnected network model, where long-running data-collection experiments are conducted in the absence of a continuous connection to the outside world. SolarStore (i) replicates data in the network until the next upload opportunity, and (ii) adapts the degree of data replication dynamically depending on solar energy and storage availability. The goal is to maximize the amount of data that can eventually be retrieved from the network subject to energy and storage constraints. Maximization of retrievable data implies minimizing sensing blackouts due to energy depletion as well as minimizing loss due to node damage in harsh environmental conditions. We have deployed an outdoor solar-powered sensor network, on which SolarStore is implemented and tested. An indoor testbed is also set up for performance evaluation under environmental conditions not attained locally. Experiments show that SolarStore is successful in dynamically responding to variations in the environment in a manner that increases retrievable data under different node failure scenarios.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll43',43)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide44" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Epilepsy affects over three million Americans of all ages. Despite recent advances, more than 20% of individuals with epilepsy never achieve adequate control of their seizures. The use of a small, portable, non-invasive seizure monitor could benefit these individuals tremendously. However, in order for such a device to be suitable for long-term wear, it must be both comfortable and lightweight.</p> <p>Typical state-of-the-art non-invasive seizure onset detection algorithms require 21 scalp electrodes to be placed on the head. These electrodes are used to generate 18 data streams, called channels. The large number of electrodes is inconvenient for the patient and processing 18 channels can consume a considerable amount of energy, a problem for a battery-powered device.</p> <p>In this paper, we describe an automated way to construct detectors that use fewer channels, and thus fewer electrodes. Starting from an existing technique for constructing 18 channel patient-specific detectors, we use machine learning to automatically construct reduced channel detectors. We evaluate our algorithm on data from 16 patients used in an earlier study. On average, our algorithm reduced the number of channels from 18 to 4.6 while decreasing the mean fraction of seizure onsets detected from 99% to 97%. For 12 out of the 16 patients, there was no degradation in the detection rate. While the average detection latency increased from 7.8 s to 11.2 s, the average rate of false alarms per hour decreased from 0.35 to 0.19.</p> <p>We also describe a prototype implementation of a single channel EEG monitoring device built using off-the-shelf components, and use this implementation to derive an energy consumption model. Using fewer channels reduced the average energy consumption by 69%, which amounts to a 3.3x increase in battery lifetime.</p> <p>Finally, we show how additional energy savings can be realized by using a low-power screening detector to rule out segments of data that are obviously not seizures. Though this technique does not reduce the number of electrodes needed, it does reduce the energy consumption by an additional 16%.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll44" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll44',44)">expand</a>
