It can provide a framework in which citizens can bring to light a civic bottleneck, hazard, personal-safety concern, cultural asset, or other data relevant to urban and natural-resources planning and services, all using data that are systematic and can be validated (http://whatsinvasive.com.) The same systems can be used as tools for sustainability.

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We present Darwin, an enabling technology for mobile phone sensing that combines collaborative sensing and classification techniques to reason about human behavior and context on mobile phones. Darwin advances mobile phone sensing through the deployment of efficient but sophisticated machine learning techniques specifically designed to run directly on sensor-enabled mobile phones (i.e., smartphones). Darwin tackles three key sensing and inference challenges that are barriers to mass-scale adoption of mobile phone sensing applications: (i) the human-burden of training classifiers, (ii) the ability to perform reliably in different environments (e.g., indoor, outdoor) and (iii) the ability to scale to a large number of phones without jeopardizing the "phone experience" (e.g., usability and battery lifetime). Darwin is a collaborative reasoning framework built on three concepts: classifier/model evolution, model pooling, and collaborative inference. To the best of our knowledge Darwin is the first system that applies distributed machine learning techniques and collaborative inference concepts to mobile phones. We implement the Darwin system on the Nokia N97 and Apple iPhone. While Darwin represents a general framework applicable to a wide variety of emerging mobile sensing applications, we implement a speaker recognition application and an augmented reality application to evaluate the benefits of Darwin. We show experimental results from eight individuals carrying Nokia N97s and demonstrate that Darwin improves the reliability and scalability of the proof-of-concept speaker recognition application without additional burden to users.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

In this paper, we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of an automatic and robust breadcrumb system for firefighter applications. Our solution includes a breadcrumb dispenser with an optimized link estimator that is used to decide when to deploy breadcrumbs to maintain reliable wireless connectivity. The solution includes accounting for realities of buildings and dispensing such as the height difference between where the dispenser is worn and the floor where the dispensed nodes are found. We also include adaptive power management to maintain link quality over time.</p> <p>Experimental results from our study show that compared to the state of the art solution [14], our breadcrumb system achieves 200% link redundancy with only 23% additional deployed nodes. Our deployed crumb-chain can achieve 90% probability of end-to-end connectivity when one node fails in the crumb-chain and over 50% probability of end-to-end connectivity when up to 3 nodes fail in the crumb-chain. In addition, by applying adaptive transmission power control at each node after the crumb-chain deployment, we solve the link quality variation problem by avoiding significant variations in packet reception ratio (PRR) and maintain PRR of over 90% at the link level.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide7" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Energy in sensor networks is a distributed, non-transferable resource. Over time, differences in energy availability are likely to arise. Protocols like routing trees may concentrate energy usage at certain nodes. Differences in energy harvesting arising from environmental variations, such as if one node is in the sun and another is in the shade, can produce variations in charging rates and battery levels. Because many sensor network applications require nodes to collaborate -- to ensure complete sensor coverage or route data to the network's edge -- a small set of nodes whose continued operation is threatened by low batteries can have a disproportionate impact on the fidelity provided by the network as a whole. In the most extreme case, the loss of a single sink node may render the remainder of the network unreachable.</p> <p>While previous research has addressed reducing the energy usage of individual nodes, the challenge of collaborative energy management has been largely ignored. We present Integrated Distributed Energy Awareness (IDEA), a sensor network service enabling effective network-wide energy decision making. IDEA integrates into the sensor network application by providing an API allowing components to evaluate their impact on other nodes. IDEA distributes information about each node's load rate, charging rate, and battery level to other nodes whose decisions affect it. Finally, IDEA enables awareness of the connection between the behavior of each node and the application's energy goals, guiding the network toward states that improve performance.</p> <p>This paper describes the IDEA architecture and demonstrates its use through three case studies. Using both simulation and testbed experiments, we evaluate each IDEA application by comparing it to simpler approaches that do not integrate distributed energy awareness. We show that using IDEA can significantly improve performance compared with solutions operating with purely local information.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll7" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll7',7)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide10" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper presents MAUI, a system that enables fine-grained energy-aware offload of mobile code to the infrastructure. Previous approaches to these problems either relied heavily on programmer support to partition an application, or they were coarse-grained requiring full process (or full VM) migration. MAUI uses the benefits of a managed code environment to offer the best of both worlds: it supports fine-grained code offload to maximize energy savings with minimal burden on the programmer. MAUI decides at run-time which methods should be remotely executed, driven by an optimization engine that achieves the best energy savings possible under the mobile device's current connectivity constrains. In our evaluation, we show that MAUI enables: 1) a resource-intensive face recognition application that consumes an order of magnitude less energy, 2) a latency-sensitive arcade game application that doubles its refresh rate, and 3) a voice-based language translation application that bypasses the limitations of the smartphone environment by executing unsupported components remotely.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>To realize the potential of opportunistic and participatory sensing using mobile smartphones, a key challenge is ensuring the ease of developing and deploying such applications, without the need for the application writer to reinvent the wheel each time. To this end, we present a Platform for Remote Sensing using Smartphones (PRISM) that balances the interconnected goals of <i>generality</i>, <i>security</i>, and <i>scalability</i>. PRISM allows application writers to package their applications as <i>executable binaries</i>, which offers efficiency and also the flexibility of reusing existing code modules. PRISM then pushes the application out automatically to an appropriate set of phones based on a specified set of predicates. This push model enables timely and scalable application deployment while still ensuring a good degree of privacy. To safely execute untrusted applications on the smartphones, while allowing them controlled access to sensitive sensor data, we augment standard software sandboxing with several PRISM-specific elements like <i>resource metering</i> and <i>forced amnesia</i>.</p> <p>We present three applications built on our implementation of PRISM on Windows Mobile: <i>citizen journalist</i>, <i>party thermometer</i>, and <i>road bump monitor</i>. These applications vary in the set of sensors they use and in their mode of operation (depending on human input vs. automatic). We report on our experience from a small-scale deployment of these applications. We also present a large-scale simulation-based analysis of the scalability of PRISM's push model.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide12" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile phones are becoming increasingly sophisticated with a rich set of on-board sensors and ubiquitous wireless connectivity. However, the ability to fully exploit the sensing capabilities on mobile phones is stymied by limitations in multimedia processing techniques. For example, search using cellphone images often encounters high error rate due to low image quality.</p> <p>In this paper, we present CrowdSearch, an accurate image search system for mobile phones. CrowdSearch combines automated image search with real-time human validation of search results. Automated image search is performed using a combination of local processing on mobile phones and backend processing on remote servers. Human validation is performed using Amazon Mechanical Turk, where tens of thousands of people are actively working on simple tasks for monetary rewards. Image search with human validation presents a complex set of tradeoffs involving energy, delay, accuracy, and monetary cost. CrowdSearch addresses these challenges using a novel predictive algorithm that determines which results need to be validated, and when and how to validate them. CrowdSearch is implemented on Apple iPhones and Linux servers. We show that CrowdSearch achieves over 95% precision across multiple image categories, provides responses within minutes, and costs only a few cents.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll12" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll12',12)">expand</a>

The 802.11 standard allows these devices to save power through an energy-conserving Power Save Mode (PSM). However, depending on the PSM implementation strategies used by the clients/Access Points (APs), we find <i>competing background traffic</i> results in one or more of the following negative consequences: a significant increase, up to 300%, in a client's energy consumption, a decrease in wireless network capacity due to unnecessary retransmissions, and unfairness.</p> <p>In this paper, we propose NAPman: Network-Assisted Power Management for WiFi devices that addresses the above issues. NAPman leverages AP virtualization and a new energy-aware fair scheduling algorithm to minimize client energy consumption and unnecessary retransmissions, while ensuring fairness among competing traffic. NAPman is incrementally deployable via software updates to the AP and does not require any changes to the 802.11 protocol or the mobile clients. Our prototype implementation improves the energy savings on a smart-phone by up to 70% under varied settings of background traffic, while ensuring fairness.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Energy management is a critical issue for mobile devices, with network activity often consuming a significant portion of the total system energy. In this paper, we propose Catnap, a system that reduces energy consumption of mobile devices by allowing them to sleep <i>during</i> data transfers. Catnap exploits high bandwidth wireless interfaces -- which offer significantly higher bandwidth compared to available bandwidth across the Internet -- by combining small gaps between packets into meaningful sleep intervals, thereby allowing the NIC as well as the device to doze off. Catnap targets data oriented applications, such as web and file transfers, which can afford delay of individual packets as long as the overall transfer times do not increase. Our evaluation shows that for small transfers (128kB to 5MB), Catnap allows the NIC to sleep for up to 70% of the total transfer time and for larger transfers, it allows the whole device to sleep for a significant fraction of the total transfer time. This results in battery life improvement of up to 2-5x for real devices like Nokia N810 and Thinkpad T60.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Urban street-parking availability statistics are challenging to obtain in real-time but would greatly benefit society by reducing traffic congestion. In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of ParkNet, a mobile system comprising vehicles that collect parking space occupancy information while driving by. Each ParkNet vehicle is equipped with a GPS receiver and a passenger-side-facing ultrasonic range-finder to determine parking spot occupancy. The data is aggregated at a central server, which builds a real-time map of parking availability and could provide this information to clients that query the system in search of parking. Creating a spot-accurate map of parking availability challenges GPS location accuracy limits. To address this need, we have devised an environmental fingerprinting approach to achieve improved location accuracy. Based on 500 miles of road-side parking data collected over 2 months, we found that parking spot counts are 95% accurate and occupancy maps can achieve over 90% accuracy. Finally, we quantify the amount of sensors needed to provide adequate coverage in a city. Using extensive GPS traces from over 500 San Francisco taxicabs, we show that if ParkNet were deployed in city taxicabs, the resulting mobile sensors would provide adequate coverage and be more cost-effective by an estimated factor of roughly 10-15 when compared to a sensor network with a dedicated sensor at every parking space, as is currently being tested in San Francisco.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Road congestion is a common problem worldwide. Existing Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) are mostly inapplicable in developing regions due to high cost and assumptions of orderly traffic. In this work, we develop a low-cost technique to estimate vehicular speed, based on vehicular honks. Honks are a characteristic feature of the chaotic road conditions common in many developing regions like India and South-East Asia.</p> <p>We envision a system where dynamic road-traffic information is learnt using inexpensive, wireless-enabled on-road sensors. Subsequent analyzed information can then be sent to mobile road users; this would fit well with the burgeoning mobile market in developing regions. The core of our technique comprises a pair of road side acoustic sensors, separated by a distance. If a moving vehicle honks between the two sensors, its speed can be estimated from the Doppler shift of the honk frequency. In this context, we have developed algorithms for honk detection, honk matching across sensors, and speed estimation. Based on the speed estimates, we subsequently detect road congestion.</p> <p>We have done extensive experiments in semi-controlled settings as well as real road scenarios under different traffic conditions. Using over 18 hours of road-side recordings, we show that our speed estimation technique is effective in real conditions. Further, we use our data to characterize traffic state as free-flowing versus congested using a variety of metrics: the vehicle speed distribution, the number and duration of honks. Our results show clear statistical divergence of congested versus free flowing traffic states, and a threshold-based classification accuracy of 70-100% in most situations.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>This paper develops a navigation service, called GreenGPS, that uses participatory sensing data to map fuel consumption on city streets, allowing drivers to find the most fuel efficient routes for their vehicles between arbitrary end-points. The service exploits measurements of vehicular fuel consumption sensors, available via the OBD-II interface standardized in all vehicles sold in the US since 1996. The interface gives access to most gauges and engine instrumentation. The most fuel-efficient route does not always coincide with the shortest or fastest routes, and may be a function of vehicle type. Our experimental study shows that a participatory sensing system can influence routing decisions of individual users and also answers two questions related to the viability of the new service. First, can it survive conditions of sparse deployment? Second, how much fuel can it save? A challenge in participatory sensing is to generalize from sparse sampling of high-dimensional spaces to produce compact descriptions of complex phenomena. We illustrate this by developing models that can predict fuel consumption of a set of sixteen different cars on the streets of the city of Urbana-Champaign. We provide experimental results from data collection suggesting that a 1% average prediction error is attainable and that an average 10% savings in fuel can be achieved by choosing the right route.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

Besides email and web browsing, a variety of network applications are now available, rendering smartphones potentially useful substitutes for their desktop counterparts. Nevertheless, the performance of smartphone applications in the wild is still poorly understood due to a lack of systematic measurement methodology.</p> <p>We identify and study important factors that impact user-perceived performance of network applications on smartphones. We develop a systematic methodology for comparing this performance along several key dimensions such as carrier networks, device capabilities, and server configurations. To ensure a fair and representative comparison, we conduct controlled experiments, informed by data collected through <i>3GTest</i>, a cross-platform measurement tool we designed, executed by more than 30,000 users from all over the world. Our work is an essential step towards understanding the performance of smartphone applications from the perspective of users, application developers, cellular network operators, and smartphone vendors. Our analysis culminates with a set of recommendations that can lead to better application design and infrastructure support for smartphone users.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Using detailed traces from 255 users, we conduct a comprehensive study of smartphone use. We characterize intentional user activities -- interactions with the device and the applications used -- and the impact of those activities on network and energy usage. We find immense diversity among users. Along all aspects that we study, users differ by one or more orders of magnitude. For instance, the average number of interactions per day varies from 10 to 200, and the average amount of data received per day varies from 1 to 1000 MB. This level of diversity suggests that mechanisms to improve user experience or energy consumption will be more effective if they learn and adapt to user behavior. We find that qualitative similarities exist among users that facilitate the task of learning user behavior. For instance, the relative application popularity for can be modeled using an exponential distribution, with different distribution parameters for different users. We demonstrate the value of adapting to user behavior in the context of a mechanism to predict future energy drain. The 90th percentile error with adaptation is less than half compared to predictions based on average behavior across users.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

Emerging Computational RFIDs (CRFIDs) provide both sensing and general-purpose computation without batteries--instead relying on small capacitors charged by energy harvesting. CRFIDs have small form factors and consume less energy than traditional sensor motes. However, CRFIDs have yet to see widespread use because of limited autonomy and the propensity for frequent power loss as a result of the necessarily small capacitors that serve as a microcontroller's power supply. Our results show that hybrid harvesting CRFIDs, which use an ambient energy micro-harvester, can complete a variety of useful workloads--even in an environment with little ambient energy available.</p> <p>Our contributions include (1) benchmarks demonstrating that micro-harvesting from ambient energy sources enables greater range and read rate, as well as autonomous operation by hybrid CRFIDs, (2) a measurement study that stresses the limits of effective ambient energy harvesting for diverse workloads, (3) application studies that demonstrate the benefits of hybrid CRFIDs, and (4) a trace-driven simulator to model and evaluate the expected behavior of a CRFID with different capacitor sizes and operating under varying conditions of mobility and solar energy harvesting. Our results show that ambient harvesting can triple the effective communication range of a CRFID, quadruple the read rate, and achieve 95% uptime in RAM retention mode despite long periods of low light.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We investigate if WiFi access can be used to augment 3G capacity in mobile environments. We rst conduct a detailed study of 3G and WiFi access from moving vehicles, in three different cities. We find that the average 3G and WiFi availability across the cities is 87% and 11%, respectively. WiFi throughput is lower than 3G through-put, and WiFi loss rates are higher. We then design a system, called Wiffler, to augments mobile 3G capacity. It uses two key ideas <i>leveraging delay tolerance</i> and <i>fast switching</i> -- to overcome the poor availability and performance of WiFi. For delay tolerant applications, Wiffler uses a simple model of the environment to predict WiFi connectivity. It uses these predictions to delays transfers to offload more data on WiFi, but only if delaying reduces 3G usage and the transfers can be completed within the application's tolerance threshold. For applications that are extremely sensitive to delay or loss (e.g., VoIP), Wiffler quickly switches to 3G if WiFi is unable to successfully transmit the packet within a small time window. We implement and deploy Wiffler in our vehicular testbed. Our experiments show that Wiffler significantly reduces 3G usage. For a realistic workload, the reduction is 45% for a delay tolerance of 60 seconds.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

We present the design and implementation of our transport protocol. We show that by adapting to the unique channel conditions of SMS we can reduce message overheads by as much as 50% and increase data throughput by as much as 545% over the approach used by existing applications. Although the transport protocol can provide efficient, low-bandwidth, moderate-latency data communication between mobile devices throughout the world, we believe that this work has the largest potential impact in developing regions where SMS is often the only option for wireless data communication.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide32" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Many applications are enabled by the ability to capture videos on a smartphone and to have these videos uploaded to an Internet-connected server. This capability requires the transfer of large volumes of data from the phone to the infrastructure. Smartphones have multiple wireless interfaces -- 3G/EDGE and WiFi -- for data transfer, but there is considerable variability in the availability and achievable data transfer rate for these networks. Moreover, the energy costs for transmitting a given amount of data on these wireless interfaces can differ by an order of magnitude. On the other hand, many of these applications are often naturally delay-tolerant, so that it is possible to delay data transfers until a lower-energy WiFi connection becomes available. In this paper, we present a principled approach for designing an optimal online algorithm for this <i>energy-delay tradeoff</i> using the Lyapunov optimization framework. Our algorithm, called SALSA, can automatically adapt to channel conditions and requires only local information to decide whether and when to defer a transmission. We evaluate SALSA using real-world traces as well as experiments using a prototype implementation on a modern smartphone. Our results show that SALSA can be tuned to achieve a broad spectrum of energy-delay tradeoffs, is closer to an empirically-determined optimal than any of the alternatives we compare it to, and, can save 10-40% of battery capacity for some workloads.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll32" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll32',32)">expand</a>

Some recent systems have incorporated surveying by users. Structuring localization systems "organically," however, introduces its own set of challenges: conveying uncertainty, determining when user input is actually required, and discounting erroneous and stale data. Through deployment of an organic location system in our nine-story building, which contains nearly 1,400 distinct spaces, we evaluate new algorithms for addressing these challenges. We describe the use of Voronoi regions for conveying uncertainty and reasoning about gaps in coverage, and a clustering method for identifying potentially erroneous user data. Our algorithms facilitate rapid coverage while maintaining positioning accuracy comparable to that achievable with survey-driven indoor deployments.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll35" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll35',35)">expand</a>

Our design is based on the observation that the required location accuracy varies with location, and hence lower energy and lower accuracy localization methods, such as those based on WiFi and cell-tower triangulation, can sometimes be used. Our method automatically determines the dynamic accuracy requirement for mobile search-based applications. As the user moves, both the accuracy requirements and the location sensor errors change. A-Loc continually tunes the energy expenditure to meet the changing accuracy requirements using the available sensors. A Bayesian estimation framework is used to model user location and sensor errors. Experiments are performed with Android G1 and AT&amp;T Tilt phones, on paths that include outdoor and indoor locations, using war-driving data from Google and Microsoft. The experiments show that a-Loc not only provides significant energy savings, but also improves the accuracy achieved, because it uses multiple sensors.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll36" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll36',36)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide37" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Many emerging smartphone applications require position information to provide location-based or context-aware services. In these applications, GPS is often preferred over its alternatives such as GSM/WiFi based positioning systems because it is known to be more accurate. However, GPS is extremely power hungry. Hence a common approach is to periodically duty-cycle GPS. However, GPS duty-cycling trades-off positioning accuracy for lower energy. A key requirement for such applications, then, is a positioning system that provides accurate position information while spending minimal energy.</p> <p>In this paper, we present RAPS, rate-adaptive positioning system for smartphone applications. It is based on the observation that GPS is generally less accurate in urban areas, so it suffices to turn on GPS only as often as necessary to achieve this accuracy. RAPS uses a collection of techniques to cleverly determine when to turn on GPS. It uses the location-time history of the user to estimate user velocity and adaptively turn on GPS only if the estimated uncertainty in position exceeds the accuracy threshold. It also efficiently estimates user movement using a duty-cycled accelerometer, and utilizes Bluetooth communication to reduce position uncertainty among neighboring devices. Finally, it employs celltower-RSS blacklisting to detect GPS unavailability (e.g., indoors) and avoid turning on GPS in these cases. We evaluate RAPS through real-world experiments using a prototype implementation on a modern smartphone and show that it can increase phone lifetimes by more than a factor of 3.8 over an approach where GPS is always on.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

The active use of these applications can however cause device battery drain owing to their power-intensive location-sensing operations. This paper presents an adaptive location sensing framework that significantly improves the energy efficiency of smartphones running location-based applications. The underlying design principles of the proposed framework involve substitution, suppression, piggybacking, and adaptation of applications' location-sensing requests to conserve energy. We implement these design principles on Android-based smartphones as a middleware. Our evaluation results show that the design principles reduce the usage of the power-intensive GPS (Global Positioning System) by up to 98% and improve battery life by up to 75%.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide41" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Ensemble is a system that uses a collection of trusted personal devices to provide proximity-based authentication in pervasive environments. Users are able to securely pair their personal devices with previously unknown devices by simply placing them close to each other (e.g., users can pair their phones by just bringing them into proximity). Ensemble leverages a user's growing collection of trusted devices, such as phones, music players, computers and personal sensors to observe transmissions made by pairing devices. These devices analyze variations in received signal strength (RSS) in order to determine whether the pairing devices are in physical proximity to each other. We show that, while individual trusted devices can not properly distinguish proximity in all cases, a collection of trusted devices can do so reliably. Our Ensemble prototype extends Diffie-Hellman key exchange with proximity-based authentication. Our experiments show that an Ensemble-enabled collection of Nokia N800 Internet Tablets can detect devices in close proximity and can reliably detect attackers as close as two meters away.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll41" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll41',41)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide42" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Docx2Go is a new framework to support editing of shared documents on mobile devices. Three high-level requirements influenced its design -- namely, the need to adapt content, especially textual content, on the fly according to the quality of the network connection and the form factor of each device; support for concurrent, uncoordinated editing on different devices, whose effects will later be merged on all devices in a convergent and consistent manner without sacrificing the semantics of the edits; and a flexible replication architecture that accommodates both device-to-device and cloud-mediated synchronization. Docx2Go supports on-the-go editing for XML documents, such as documents in Microsoft Word and other commonly used formats. It combines the best practices from content adaptation systems, weakly consistent replication systems, and collaborative editing systems, while extending the state of the art in each of these fields. The implementation of Docx2Go has been evaluated based on a workload drawn from Wikipedia.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll42" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll42',42)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide43" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Sensor networks have been conventionally defined as a network of sensor motes that collaboratively detect events and report them to a remote monitoring station. This paper makes an attempt to extend this notion to the social context by using mobile phones as replacement of motes. We envision a social application where mobile phones collaboratively sense their ambience and recognize socially "interesting" events. The phone with a good view of the event triggers a video recording, and later, the video-clips from different phones are "stitched" into a video highlights of the occasion. We observe that such a video highlights is akin to the notion of event coverage in conventional sensor networks, only the notion of "event" has changed from physical to social. We have built a Mobile Phone based Video Highlights system (MoVi) using Nokia phones and iPod Nanos, and have experimented in real-life social gatherings. Results show that MoVi-generated video highlights (created offline) are quite similar to those created manually, (i.e., by painstakingly editing the entire video of the occasion). In that sense, MoVi can be viewed as a collaborative information distillation tool capable of filtering events of social relevance.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll43" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll43',43)">expand</a>
