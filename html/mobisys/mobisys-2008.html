<span id="toHide1" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Phenomenal growth in the performance and functionality of portable electronic devices has transformed our notion of mobile computing from its roots in the early 90's. In fact, some of the advances are so remarkable that 20 years ago they would have seemed improbable; the exponential growth in the density of solid-state storage being a prime example. Looking forward, can we expect a similar leap in mobile capabilities over the next 20 years? In this presentation, I will examine the trends in processing, storage, wireless networking, displays, data-entry, sensing and battery design, trying to predict the properties of future mobile computers. In order to better understand how the evolution of mobile technology will progress, I will also consider how our lives, needs and work practices might shape the design of these systems, and provide us with powerful tools that are not only functional, but enable a richer user experience.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll1" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll1',1)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide4" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Railway systems are critical in many regions, and can consist of several tens of thousands of bridges, being used over several decades. It is critical to have a system to monitor the health of these bridges and report when and where maintenance operations are needed. This paper presents BriMon, a wireless sensor network based system for such monitoring. The design of BriMon is driven by two important factors: application requirements, and detailed measurement studies of several pieces of the architecture. In comparison with prior bridge monitoring systems and sensor network prototypes, our contributions are three-fold. First, we have designed a novel event detection mechanism that triggers data collection in response to an oncoming train. Next, BriMon employs a simple yet effective multi-channel data transfer mechanism to transfer the collected data onto a sink located on the moving train. Third, the BriMon architecture is designed with careful consideration of the interaction between the multiple requisite functionalities such as time synchronization, event detection, routing, and data transfer. Based on a prototype implementation, this paper also presents several measurement studies to show that our design choices are indeed quite effective.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll4" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll4',4)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide5" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Automotive traffic monitoring using probe vehicles with Global Positioning System receivers promises significant improvements in cost, coverage, and accuracy. Current approaches, however, raise privacy concerns because they require participants to reveal their positions to an external traffic monitoring server. To address this challenge, we propose a system based on virtual trip lines and an associated cloaking technique. Virtual trip lines are geographic markers that indicate where vehicles should provide location updates. These markers can be placed to avoid particularly privacy sensitive locations. They also allow aggregating and cloaking several location updates based on trip line identifiers, without knowing the actual geographic locations of these trip lines. Thus they facilitate the design of a distributed architecture, where no single entity has a complete knowledge of probe identities and fine-grained location information. We have implemented the system with GPS smartphone clients and conducted a controlled experiment with 20 phone-equipped drivers circling a highway segment. Results show that even with this low number of probe vehicles, travel time estimates can be provided with less than 15% error, and applying the cloaking techniques reduces travel time estimation accuracy by less than 5% compared to a standard periodic sampling approach.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll5" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll5',5)">expand</a>

We describe a system and associated algorithms to monitor this important civil infrastructure using a collection of sensor-equipped vehicles. This system, which we call the Pothole Patrol (P<sup>2</sup>), uses the inherent mobility of the participating vehicles, opportunistically gathering data from vibration and GPS sensors, and processing the data to assess road surface conditions. We have deployed P<sup>2</sup> on 7 taxis running in the Boston area. Using a simple machine-learning approach, we show that we are able to identify potholes and other severe road surface anomalies from accelerometer data. Via careful selection of training data and signal features, we have been able to build a detector that misidentifies good road segments as having potholes less than 0.2% of the time. We evaluate our system on data from thousands of kilometers of taxi drives, and show that it can successfully detect a number of real potholes in and around the Boston area. After clustering to further reduce spurious detections, manual inspection of reported potholes shows that over 90% contain road anomalies in need of repair.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll6" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll6',6)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide9" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>We present the design and evaluation of an 802.11-like wireless link layer protocol that obfuscates all transmitted bits to increase privacy. This includes explicit identifiers such as MAC addresses, the contents of management messages, and other protocol fields that the existing 802.11 protocol relies on to be sent in the clear. By obscuring these fields, we greatly increase the difficulty of identifying or profiling users from their transmissions in ways that are otherwise straightforward. Our design, called SlyFi, is nearly as efficient as existing schemes such as WPA for discovery, link setup, and data delivery despite its heightened protections; transmission requires only symmetric key encryption and reception requires a table lookup followed by symmetric key decryption. Experiments using our implementation on Atheros 802.11 drivers show that SlyFi can discover and associate with networks faster than 802.11 using WPA-PSK. The overhead SlyFi introduces in packet delivery is only slightly higher than that added by WPA-CCMP encryption (10% vs. 3% decrease in throughput).</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll9" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll9',9)">expand</a>

We experimentally demonstrate that current network interfaces employ policies that result in long outage durations, even when clients are always in range of at least one access point. Consequently, we design and evaluate a family of client-driven handoff techniques that target vehicular mobility in multi-tier multi-hop wireless mesh networks. Our key technique is for clients to invoke an association change based on (i) joint use of channel quality measurements and AP quality scores that reflect long-term differences in AP performance and (ii) controlled measurement and hand-off time scales to balance the need for the instantaneously best association against performance penalties incurred from spurious handoffs due to channel fluctuations and marginally improved associations. We utilize a 4,000 user urban deployment to evaluate the performance of a broad class of hand-off policies.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll10" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll10',10)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide11" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Using 802.11 concurrently for communications and positioning is problematic, especially if location-based services (e.g., indoor navigation) are concurrently executed with real-time applications (e.g., VoIP, video conferencing). Periodical scanning for measuring the signal strength interrupts the data flow. Reducing the scan frequency is no option because it hurts the position accuracy. For this reason, we need an adaptive technique to mitigate this problem.</p> <p>This work proposes ComPoScan which, based on movement detection, adaptively switches between light-weight monitor sniffing and invasive active scanning to allow positioning and to minimize the impact on the data flow. The system is configurable to realize different trade-offs between position accuracy and the level of communication interruption.</p> <p>We provide extensive experimental results by emulation on data collected at several sites and by validation in several real-world deployments. Results from the emulation show that the system can realize different trade-offs by changing parameters. Furthermore, the emulation shows that the system works independently of the environment, the network card, the signal strength measurement technology, and number and placement of access points. We also show that ComPoScan does not harm the positioning accuracy of a positioning system. By validation in several real-world deployments, we provided evidence for that the real system works as predicted by the emulation. In addition, we provide results for ComPoScan's impact on communication where it increases throughput by a factor of 122, decreases the delay by a factor of ten, and the percentage of dropped packages by 73 percent.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll11" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll11',11)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide14" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>It is now common for Web sites to use active Web content, such as Flash, Silverlight, or Java applets, to support rich, interactive applications. For many mobile devices, however, supporting active content is problematic. First, the physical resource requirements of the browser plug-ins that execute active content may exceed the capabilities of the device. Second, plug-ins are simply not available for many devices. Finally, active code and the plug-ins that execute it often contain security flaws, potentially exposing a user's device or private data to harm.</p> <p>This paper explores a proxy-based approach for transparently supporting active Web content on mobile devices. Our approach uses a proxy to splice active content out of Web pages and replace it with an AJAX-based remote display component. The spliced active content executes within a remote sandbox on the proxy, but it appears embedded in the Web page on the mobile device's browser.</p> <p>To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we have designed, implemented, and evaluated Flashproxy. By using Flashproxy, any mobile Web browser that supports JavaScript transparently inherits the ability to access sites that contain Flash programs. The major challenge in Flashproxy is in trapping and handling interactions between the Flash program and its execution environment, including browser interactions. Flashproxy uses binary rewriting of Flash bytecode to interpose on such interactions, redirecting them through a JavaScript-based RPC layer to the user's browser. Our evaluation of Flashproxy shows that it is transparent, performant, and compatible with nearly all Flash programs that we examined.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll14" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll14',14)">expand</a>

This is achieved by enabling web applications to split their client-side pages across a pair of browsers: one untrusted browser running on a public PC and one trusted browser running on the user's personal mobile device, composed into a single logical interface through a local connection, wired or wireless. Information entered via the personal device's keypad cannot be read by the PC, thwarting PC-based key-loggers. Similarly, information displayed on the personal device's screen is also hidden from the PC, preserving the confidentiality and integrity of security-critical data even in the presence of screen grabbing attacks and compromised PC browsers. We present a security policy model for split-trust web applications that defends against a range of crimeware-based attacks, including those based on active-injection (e.g. inserting malicious packets into the network or spoofing user-input events). Performance results of a prototype split-trust implementation are presented, using a commercially available cell phone as a trusted personal device.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll15" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll15',15)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide16" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Today's Internet is incapable of handling information like a stop sign. Such information stays in a geographic region, consistently beams to the people who move into from certain direction. This paper presents a system aimed at bridging the Internet with the physical world. The hardware platform of the system consists of a central server and a set of position-aware mobile clients that communicate with the server through means of wireless networks. Each client has a capable zone, a circular region centered on its current position with a user-defined radius. Each piece of information managed by the server is a geopage, an HTML page associated with a geographic region. As clients move, they load with the geopages implanted in their surroundings. This paper identifies the technical challenges of managing a large number of geopages that spans over a large terrain with a large number of mobile clients, and proposes a cost-effective solution that minimizes mobile communication and server processing costs. We evaluate the scalability of the proposed technique with a detailed mathematical model. The accuracy of the model is verified using simulation. We have also implemented a prototype and field tested the system in several cities.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll16" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll16',16)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide19" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Increasingly, 802.11 devices are being used by mobile users. This results in very dynamic wireless channels that are difficult to use efficiently. Current rate selection algorithms are dominated by probe-based approaches that search for the best transmission rate using trial-and-error. In mobile environments, probe-based techniques often perform poorly because they inefficiently search for the moving target presented by the constantly changing channel. We have developed a channel-aware rate adaptation algorithm CHARM - that uses signal strength measurements collected by the wireless cards to help select the transmission rate. Moreover, unlike previous approaches CHARM leverages channel reciprocity to obtain channel information, so the information is available to the transmitter without incurring RTS/CTS overhead. This combination of techniques allows CHARM to respond quickly to dynamic channel changes. We implemented CHARM in the Madwifi driver for wireless cards using the Atheros chipset. Our evaluation both in the real world and on a controlled testbed shows that channel-aware rate selection can significantly outperform probe-based rate adaptation, especially over dynamic channels.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll19" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll19',19)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide20" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Adaptive transmit power control in 802.11 Wireless LANs (WLANs) on a per-link basis helps increase network capacity and improves battery life of Wifi-enabled mobile devices. However, it faces the following challenges: (1) it can exacerbate receiver-side interference and asymmetric channel access, (2) it can incorrectly lead to lowering the data rate of a link, (3) mobility-induced channel variations at short timescales make detecting and avoiding these problems more complex. Despite significant research in rate and power control, state of the art solutions lack comprehensive techniques to address the above problems.</p> <p>In this paper, we design and implement Symphony - a Synchronous Two-phase Rate and Power control system, whose agility in adaptation enables us to systematically address the three problems, while maximizing the benefits of power control on a per-link basis. We implement Symphony in the Linux Madwifi driver, and show that it can be realized on hardware that supports transmit power control with no modifications to the 802.11 MAC, thereby fostering immediate deployability. Our extensive experimental evaluation on a real testbed in an office environment demonstrates that Symphony (1) enables up to 80% of the clients in 3 different cells to settle at 50% to 94% lower transmit power than a per-cell power control solution, (2) increases network throughput by up to 50% across realistic deployment scenarios, (3) improves the throughput of asymmetry-affected links by 300%, and (4) opportunistically reduces the transmit power of mobile clients running VOIP calls by up to 97%, while causing minimum impact on voice quality.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll20" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll20',20)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide21" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Wireless interfaces are major power consumers on mobile systems. Considerable research has improved the energy efficiency of elongated idle periods or created more elongated idle periods in wireless interfaces, often requiring cooperation from applications or the network infrastructure. With increasing wireless mobile data, it has become critical to improve the energy efficiency of active wireless interfaces. In this work, we present micro power management (μPM), a solution inspired by the mismatch between the high performance of state-of-the-art 802.11 interfaces and the modest data rate requirements by many popular network applications. μPM enables an 802.11 interface to enter unreachable power-saving modes even between MAC frames, without noticeable impact on the traffic flow. To control data loss, μPM leverages the retransmission mechanism in 802.11 and controls frame delay to adapt to demanded network throughput with minimal cooperation from the access point. Based on a theoretical framework, we employ simulation to systematically investigate an effective and efficient implementation of μPM. We have built a prototype μPM on an open-access wireless hardware platform. Measurements show that more than 30% power reduction for the wireless transceiver can be achieved with μPM for various applications without perceptible quality degradation.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll21" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll21',21)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide24" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile phones have the potential to be useful agents for their owners by detecting and reporting situations that are of interest. Several challenges emerge in the case of detecting and reporting nice to know situations. Being alerted of these events may not be of critical importance but may be useful if the user is not busy. For detection, the precision of sensing must be high enough to minimize annoying false notifications, despite the constraints imposed by the inaccuracy of commodity sensors and the limited battery power available on mobile phones. For reporting, the notifications cannot be too obtrusive to the user or those in the vicinity. Peripheral cues are appropriate for conveying information like proximity, but have been studied primarily in settings like offices where sensors and cueing mechanisms can be controlled.</p> <p>We explore these issues through the design of PeopleTones, a buddy proximity application for mobile phones. We contribute (1) an algorithm for detecting proximity, (2) techniques for reducing sensor noise and power consumption, and (3) a method for generating peripheral cues. Empirical measurements demonstrate the precision and recall characteristics of our proximity algorithm. A two-week study of three groups of friends using PeopleTones shows that our techniques were effective, enabling the study of how people respond to peripheral cues in the wild. Our qualitative findings underscore the importance of cue selection and personal control for peripheral cues.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll24" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll24',24)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide25" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Recent years have witnessed the impacts of distributed content sharing (Wikipedia, Blogger), social networks (Facebook, MySpace), sensor networks, and pervasive computing. We believe that significant more impact is latent in the convergence of these ideas on the mobile phone platform. Phones can be envisioned as people-centric sensors capable of aggregating participatory as well as sensory inputs from local surroundings. The inputs can be visualized in different dimensions, such as space and time. When plugged into the Internet, the collaborative inputs from phones may enable a high resolution view of the world. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of one such system, called Micro-Blog. New kinds of application-driven challenges are identified and addressed in the context of this system. Implemented on Nokia N95 mobile phones, Micro-Blog was distributed to volunteers for real life use. Promising feedback suggests that Micro-Blog can be a deployable tool for sharing, browsing, and querying global information.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll25" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll25',25)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide26" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Over the course of a day a human interacts with tens or hundreds of individual objects. Many of these articles are nomadic, relying on human memory to manually index, inventory, organize, search, and locate them. However, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags hold great promise for automating these tasks. While originally envisioned for managing supply chains and store inventories, RFID tags support the properties necessary for helping humans to manage their objects. This paper presents Sherlock, a system that leverages RFID tags for human-object interaction. Sherlock combines concepts from sensors, radar technology, and computer graphics to implement a novel localization and visualization system for everyday objects. At the heart of Sherlock is a new RFID localization technique that uses steerable antennas to sweep a room, discovering, localizing and indexing tagged objects. In response to user queries, Sherlock displays the locations of matching objects using images from a video camera. We have implemented a prototype of Sherlock to conduct experiments in a real office environment. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Sherlock in localizing to a volume of less than 0.55 cubic meters for 90% of objects.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll26" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll26',26)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide29" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Many people desire ubiquitous access to their personal computing environments. We present a system in which a user leverages a personal mobile device to establish trust in a public computing device, or kiosk, prior to resuming her environment on the kiosk. We have designed a protocol by which the mobile device determines the identity and integrity of all software loaded on the kiosk, in order to inform the user whether the kiosk is trustworthy. Our system exploits emerging hardware security technologies, namely the Trusted Platform Module and new support in x86 processors for establishing a dynamic root of trust. We have demonstrated the viability of our approach by implementing and evaluating our system on commodity hardware. Through a brief survey, we found that respondents are generally willing to endure a delay in exchange for an increased assurance of data privacy, and that the delay incurred by our unoptimized prototype is close to the range tolerable to the respondents. We have focused on allowing the user to personalize a kiosk by running her own virtual machine there. However, our work is generally applicable to establishing trust on public computing devices before revealing any sensitive information to those devices.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll29" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll29',29)">expand</a>

Such devices offer many new opportunities for cooperative sensing applications. For example, users' mobile phones may contribute data to community-oriented information services, from city-wide pollution monitoring to enterprise-wide detection of unauthorized Wi-Fi access points. This people-centric mobile-sensing model introduces a new security challenge in the design of mobile systems: protecting the privacy of participants while allowing their devices to reliably contribute high-quality data to these large-scale applications.</p> <p>We describe AnonySense, a privacy-aware architecture for realizing pervasive applications based on collaborative, opportunistic sensing by personal mobile devices. AnonySense allows applications to submit sensing tasks that will be distributed across anonymous participating mobile devices, later receiving verified, yet anonymized, sensor data reports back from the field, thus providing the first secure implementation of this participatory sensing model. We describe our trust model, and the security properties that drove the design of the AnonySense system. We evaluate our prototype implementation through experiments that indicate the feasibility of this approach, and through two applications: a Wi-Fi rogue access point detector and a lost-object finder.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll30" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll30',30)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide33" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>A novel behavioral detection framework is proposed to detect mobile worms, viruses and Trojans, instead of the signature-based solutions currently available for use in mobile devices. First, we propose an efficient representation of malware behaviors based on a key observation that the logical ordering of an application's actions over time often reveals the malicious intent even when each action alone may appear harmless. Then, we generate a database of malicious behavior signatures by studying more than 25 distinct families of mobile viruses and worms targeting the Symbian OS - the most widely-deployed handset OS - and their variants. Next, we propose a two-stage mapping technique that constructs these signatures at run-time from the monitored system events and API calls in Symbian OS. We discriminate the malicious behavior of malware from the normal behavior of applications by training a classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our evaluation on both simulated and real-world malware samples indicates that behavioral detection can identify current mobile viruses and worms with more than 96% accuracy. We also find that the time and resource overheads of constructing the behavior signatures from low-level API calls are acceptably low for their deployment in mobile devices.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll33" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll33',33)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide34" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Mobile users of computation and communication services have been rapidly adopting battery-powered mobile handhelds, such as PocketPCs and SmartPhones, for their work. However, the limited battery-lifetime of these devices restricts their portability and applicability, and this weakness can be exacerbated by mobile malware targeting depletion of battery energy. Such malware are usually difficult to detect and prevent, and frequent outbreaks of new malware variants also reduce the effectiveness of commonly-seen signature-based detection. To alleviate these problems, we propose a power-aware malware-detection framework that monitors, detects, and analyzes previously unknown energy-depletion threats. The framework is composed of (1) a power monitor which collects power samples and builds a power consumption history from the collected samples, and (2) a data analyzer which generates a power signature from the constructed history. To generate a power signature, simple and effective noise-filtering and data-compression are applied, thus reducing the detection overhead. Similarities between power signatures are measured by the <sub><i>χ</i></sub><sup>2</sup>-distance, reducing both false-positive and false-negative detection rates. According to our experimental results on an HP iPAQ running a Windows Mobile OS, the proposed framework achieves significant (up to 95%) storage-savings without losing the detection accuracy, and a 99% true-positive rate in classifying mobile malware.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll34" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll34',34)">expand</a>

In this paper, we extend the domain of RFID by presenting SixthSense, a platform for RFID-based enterprise intelligence systems. We consider an enterprise setting where people (or rather their employee badges) and their personal objects such as books and mobiles are tagged with cheap, passive RFID tags, and there is good coverage of RFID readers in the workplace. SixthSense combines mobility information obtained from RFID-based sensing with information from enterprise systems such as calendar and presence, to automatically draw inferences about the association and interaction amongst people, objects, and workspaces. For instance, SixthSense is able to automatically distinguish between people and objects, learn the identities of people, and infer the ownership of objects by people.</p> <p>We characterize the performance of a state-of-the-art RFID system used in our testbed, present our inference algorithms, and evaluate these both in a small testbed and via simulations. We also present the SixthSense programming model that exposes a rich API to applications. To demonstrate the capabilities of the SixthSense platform, we present a few applications built using these APIs, including a mis placed object alert service, an enhanced calendar service, and rich annotation of video with physical events. We also discuss the issue of safeguarding user privacy in the context of SixthSense.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll37" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll37',37)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide38" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Proactively providing services to mobile individuals is essential for emerging ubiquitous applications. The major challenge in providing users with proactive services lies in continuously monitoring their contexts based on numerous sensors. The context monitoring with rich sensors imposes heavy workloads on mobile devices with limited computing and battery power. We present SeeMon, a scalable and energy-efficient context monitoring framework for sensor-rich, resource-limited mobile environments. Running on a personal mobile device, SeeMon effectively performs context monitoring involving numerous sensors and applications. On top of SeeMon, multiple applications on the device can proactively understand users' contexts and react appropriately. This paper proposes a novel context monitoring approach that provides efficient processing and sensor control mechanisms. We implement and test a prototype system on two mobile devices: a UMPC and a wearable device with a diverse set of sensors. Example applications are also developed based on the implemented system. Experimental results show that SeeMon achieves a high level of scalability and energy efficiency.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll38" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll38',38)">expand</a>

<span id="toHide39" style="display:none;"><br><div style="display:inline"><p>Cascadia is a system that provides RFID-based pervasive computing applications with an infrastructure for specifying, extracting and managing meaningful high-level events from raw RFID data. Cascadia provides three important services. First, it allows application developers and even users to specify events using either a declarative query language or an intuitive visual language based on direct manipulation. Second, it provides an API that facilitates the development of applications which rely on RFID-based events. Third, it automatically detects the specified events, forwards them to registered applications and stores them for later use (e.g., for historical queries).</p> <p>We present the design and implementation of Cascadia along with an evaluation that includes both a user study and measurements on traces collected in a building-wide RFID deployment. To demonstrate how Cascadia facilitates application development, we built a simple digital diary application in the form of a calendar that populates itself with RFID-based events. Cascadia copes with ambiguous RFID data and limitations in an RFID deployment by transforming RFID readings into probabilistic events. We show that this approach outperforms deterministic event detection techniques while avoiding the need to specify and train sophisticated models.</p></div></span> <a id="expcoll39" href="JavaScript: expandcollapse('expcoll39',39)">expand</a>
